V  THE RED DOT  Written by Larry David     (Comedy club)   I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?    (Commercial)   At a party

p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE

p14
tp15

p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE

p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V It was a gift.  
p23
tp24

p181
V (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.    
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.   
p185
tp186
a(V ELAINE 
p187
V Where's my drink?  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?

V I think he was impressed.  
p194
tp195

V Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.   
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.   
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V Told you.   At a clothing store.  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.   
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V Do I really have to buy her something?    
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?   
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V What is that? Is that cashmere?  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Yeah. She would love cashmere.  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.   
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Wow. Excuse me, Miss?  
p236
tp237
a(V WOMAN 
p238
V Yes?  
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?    
p242
tp243
a(V WOMAN 
p244
V (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.   
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V What? I don't see anything.  
p248
tp249
a(V WOMAN 
p250
V See this red dot?  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Oh yeah.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)    
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?    
p260
tp261
a(V WOMAN 
p262
V There's no exchanges on this.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V You think she would care about the red dot?   
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V It's hard to say.  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?   
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V Well I can see it.  
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V Yeah, but you know where it is.  
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?   
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?   
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.   
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?   
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V You want me to take an overview?  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V Please.  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.    At Jerry's apartment.  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V Yeah so?  
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.   
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V Oh boy, can you smell it?  
p308
tp309
a(V ELAINE 
p310
V No. I can't smell it.  
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.   
p314
tp315
a(V ELAINE 
p316
V You don't always smell someone from a drink.   
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Yes you do.  
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?   
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Yes you would.   Kramer enters  
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?    
p329
tp330
a(V KRAMER 
p331
V Okay.  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Would you take a drink and let us smell you?   
p335
tp336
a(V KRAMER 
p337
V You can smell me without the drink.    
p338
tp339
a(V ELAINE 
p340
V I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.    
p341
tp342
a(V KRAMER 
p343
V Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?   
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.    Kramer drinks.  
p347
tp348
a(V KRAMER 
p349
V All right.   Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V I don't smell anything.  
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V Maybe we're too close to the bottle.     Jerry's buzzer buzzes.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Yeah.  
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V (over the speaker) It's George.  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Come on up.  
p365
tp366
a(V KRAMER 
p367
V That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.   
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V Hello everybody.  
p371
tp372
a(V KRAMER 
p373
V Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V (uncomfortablly) Thank you.  
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V Hey what's that?  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V It's an early Christmas present.  
p383
tp384
a(V ELAINE 
p385
V Christmas present? For who?  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V For you.  
p389
tp390
a(V ELAINE 
p391
V *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.    
p392
tp393
a(V KRAMER 
p394
V Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...    
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Kramer. Yeah that'll do.  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V Of course it's cashmere.  
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V Oh, I love cashmere.  
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V Well who doesn't.  
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V My, George this must have cost a fortune.    
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V Ahh, money.  
p416
tp417
a(V ELAINE 
p418
V Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?   
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.   
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.   
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.   
p428
tp429
a(V KRAMER 
p430
V What's that red dot on your sweater?    
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V What?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.   
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.   
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V What don't you know?  
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V I don't know.  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V Well do you see it or don't you?  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Ahem. Say that again?  
p458
tp459
a(V ELAINE 
p460
V Do you see it or don't you?  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.    Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.   
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Now what did you ask me again.   Kramer is snoring.   (Commercial)   (Whew, Jerry is saved by the bell.)   At the office. Elaine is walking by.  
p467
tp468
a(V ELAINE 
p469
V You're still here. You're a dynamo.    
p470
tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V I can't believe I get paid for this.    
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V I'll see you tomorrow.   Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.   
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V How you doing?   CLEANING LADY  Hello.   The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.    At Monk's.  
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?   
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.    
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.   
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V Why is that?  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.    
p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)   
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V Convulsing?  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V Convulsing?  
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V I don't know, I'm trying to help you.    
p506
tp507
a(V GEORGE 
p508
V Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.    
p509
tp510
a(V JERRY 
p511
V You don't drink.  
p512
tp513
a(V GEORGE 
p514
V I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.   
p515
tp516
a(V JERRY 
p517
V So you started drinking.  
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.   
p521
tp522
a(V JERRY 
p523
V So how was it?  
p524
tp525
a(V GEORGE 
p526
V Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.   
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V Good thing the cleaning lady was there.     At Jerry's apartment.  
p530
tp531
a(V ELAINE 
p532
V Dick was fired.  
p533
tp534
a(V JERRY 
p535
V You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.    
p536
tp537
a(V ELAINE 
p538
V You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?   
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V What are you saying?  
p542
tp543
a(V ELAINE 
p544
V I'm not saying anything.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY

V You're saying something.  
p548
tp549
a(V ELAINE 
p550
V What could I be saying?  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.   
p554
tp555
a(V ELAINE 
p556
V If I was saying something I would have said it.   
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V Well why don't you say it?  
p560
tp561
a(V ELAINE 
p562
V I said it.  
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V What did you say?  
p566
tp567
a(V ELAINE 
p568
V Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.    Jerry's buzzer buzzes.  
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V Yeah?  
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V (over the speaker) It's George.  
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V Come on up.  
p578
tp579
a(V ELAINE 
p580
V Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.   
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V No I didn't.  
p584
tp585
a(V ELAINE 
p586
V Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.   
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.   
p590
tp591
a(V ELAINE 
p592
V How much did he save?  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.    Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.   
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.   
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V Did you tell her anything?  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V No.  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Do you swear?  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.    
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V Oh you told her didn't you.  
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V No.  
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?   
p623
tp624
a(V GEORGE 
p625
V What? Did I what?  
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V You did didn't you.  
p629
tp630
a(V GEORGE 
p631
V Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.    
p632
tp633
a(V ELAINE 
p634
V Well Jerry told me that you did.  
p635
tp636
a(V GEORGE 
p637
V You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.   
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.   
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.    At the office.  
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE 
p646
V This is for you.  
p647
tp648
a(V LADY 
p649
V Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.   
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.   
p653
tp654
a(V LADY 
p655
V Okay, okay, can I open it now?  
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.    
p659
tp660
a(V LADY 
p661
V Oh! Is that cashmere?  
p662
tp663
a(V GEORGE 
p664
V Of course it's cashemere.  
p665
tp666
a(V LADY 
p667
V A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!    
p668
tp669
a(V GEORGE 
p670
V Just a little something for Christmas.    
p671
tp672
a(V LADY 
p673
V When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.   
p674
tp675
a(V GEORGE 
p676
V I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.    
p677
tp678
a(V LADY 
p679
V Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.    
p680
tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V Take it off. You're going to ruin it.    
p683
tp684
a(V LADY 
p685
V (noticing the dot) What's this?   At the comedy club.  
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.   
p689
tp690
a(V DICK 
p691
V The only stench is comming from you.    
p692
tp693
a(V AUDIENCE 
p694
V Oooooh.  
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.   
p698
tp699
a(V DICK 
p700
V It's off the wagon.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?    
p704
tp705
a(V DICK 
p706
V I don't know.  
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?   
p710
tp711
a(V DICK 
p712
V You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.   
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?   
p716
tp717
a(V DICK 
p718
V What the hell do you know about wagons?    
p719
tp720
a(V JERRY 
p721
V I know enough not to get on them.   In the boss' office.  
p722
tp723
a(V BOSS 
p724
V I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?   
p725
tp726
a(V GEORGE 
p727
V Who said that?  
p728
tp729
a(V BOSS 
p730
V She did.  
p731
tp732
a(V GEORGE 
p733
V Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.   
p734
tp735
a(V BOSS 
p736
V You're fired.  
p737
tp738
a(V GEORGE 
p739
V Well you didn't have to say it like that.   
p740
tp741
a(V BOSS 
p742
V I want you out of here by the end of the day.   
p743
tp744
a(V GEORGE 
p745
V What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?   
p746
tp747
a(V BOSS 
p748
V Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.    He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it.    In the hall of the office.  
p749
tp750
a(V ELAINE 
p751
V You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.   
p752
tp753
a(V GEORGE 
p754
V You never had sex in the office before?    
p755
tp756
a(V ELAINE 
p757
V No. I once made out with someone but that was it.   
p758
tp759
a(V GEORGE 
p760
V Alright so you made out with someone.    
p761
tp762
a(V ELAINE 
p763
V Well that's not sex.  
p764
tp765
a(V GEORGE 
p766
V Kissing is sex.  
p767
tp768
a(V ELAINE 
p769
V Kissing is not sex.  
p770
tp771
a(V JERRY 
p772
V George?  
p773
tp774
a(V GEORGE 
p775
V Jerry.  
p776
tp777
a(V ELAINE 
p778
V Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?   
p779
tp780
a(V GEORGE 
p781
V No.  
p782
tp783
a(V JERRY 
p784
V George?  
p785
tp786
a(V GEORGE 
p787
V Over here.  
p788
tp789
a(V ELAINE 
p790
V What are you doing here?  
p791
tp792
a(V JERRY 
p793
V I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.   
p794
tp795
a(V ELAINE 
p796
V Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?   
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.    (Commercial)  
p800
tp801
a(V ELAINE 
p802
V So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.   
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.    *crash*  
p806
tp807
a(V DICK 
p808
V Merry Christmas.  
p809
tp810
a(V ELAINE 
p811
V Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.    
p812
tp813
a(V GEORGE 
p814
V Hide, hide under the desk.  
p815
tp816
a(V ELAINE 
p817
V Ow, ow move over.  
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V Get off of me.  
p821
tp822
a(V ELAINE 
p823
V I've got no room.   Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.   
p824
tp825
a(V DICK 
p826
V Is that cashmere?  
p827
tp828
a(V GEORGE 
p829
V Of course it's cashmere.  
p830
tp831
a(V DICK 
p832
V (noticing the dot) What's this?   At the comedy club.  
p833
tp834
a(V JERRY 
p835
V But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.   
p836
tp837
a(V DICK 
p838
V You mean on the wagon.  
p839
tp840
a.
