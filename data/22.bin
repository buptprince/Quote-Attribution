V  THE PARKING GARAGE  Written by Larry David   INT. ESCALATOR - GOING DOWN TO A GARAGE.    IN SINGLE FILE  GEORGE, JERRY and ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING  A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER  WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE,  HEAVY BOX.    One left...what a joke.  
p2
tp3
a(V KRAMER 
p4
V You can have this one.  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.   
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V Hey, I didn't get one either.  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?   
p14
tp15
a(V ELAINE 
p16
V This is what people do.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.    
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.    
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?   
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.   
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Big accomplishment. GEORGE Fish. What do they do?   
p32
tp33
a(V ELAINE 
p34
V What do you do?  
p35
tp36
a(V KRAMER 
p37
V (RE: CAR) It's this way.  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V What time is it?  
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Five o'clock.  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V Always late. Always late.  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V You're not late.  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.   
p53
tp54
a(V ELAINE 
p55
V Who?  
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?    
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.   
p62
tp63
a(V ELAINE 
p64
V Isn't it going the other way?  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.    ELAINE But it's Saturday. JERRY You got the picnic and burger traffic. GEORGE I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.    KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND.   
p68
tp69
a(V ELAINE 
p70
V What's the matter?   HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING.   
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?     KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER.   
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V You want me to help you with that?    
p77
tp78
a(V KRAMER 
p79
V No, no, I got it.   AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.   
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?   
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.    
p86
tp87
a(V KRAMER 
p88
V If you like her, go talk to her.  
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"   
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.   
p95
tp96
a(V KRAMER 
p97
V She's fat.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V Oh she's fat?   KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED.   
p101
tp102
a(V ELAINE 
p103
V What?  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V Where's the car?  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V I thought it was here.  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V You don't know where we parked?   KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW.   
p113
tp114
a(V GEORGE 
p115
V Oh, this is great.  
p116
tp117
a(V KRAMER 
p118
V Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.    
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.   
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V I didn't pay attention.  
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V This is just what I need.  
p128
tp129
a(V ELAINE 
p130
V I'm sure it's right around here.  
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.    
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.   
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V It's over there. I know where it is.     NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW.   
p140
tp141
a(V ELAINE 
p142
V It's black, right?  
p143
tp144
a(V KRAMER 
p145
V Dark blue.  
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?   
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.     THEY STOP...   
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V Hmmm...I thought it was...  
p155
tp156
a(V KRAMER 
p157
V Didn't we come in over there?  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V I thought it was over there.  
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?   
p164
tp165
a(V KRAMER 
p166
V About two hours.  
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V You'd better find this car.  
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V It's this way...  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V I really have to go to the bathroom.    
p176
tp177
a(V KRAMER 
p178
V Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J    JERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.   
p179
tp180
a(V KRAMER 
p181
V Why? Nobody's around.  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V I'll wait.  
p185
tp186
a(V KRAMER 
p187
V You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. JERRY Alright.   
p188
tp189
a(V KRAMER 
p190
V Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?   
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.     ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE...   
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINE 
p196
V There it is!...No that's not it.   A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED.   
p197
tp198
a(V ELAINE 
p199
V Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.   
p200
tp201
a(V GEORGE 
p202
V ...Six wrong?  
p203
tp204
a(V ELAINE 
p205
V Those school zones are a killer.  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Will you let me help you with that?    
p209
tp210
a(V KRAMER 
p211
V I'm gonna put it down behind that car.     HE DOES SO.   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?   
p215
tp216
a(V KRAMER 
p217
V Pink eleven. Remember that.  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.   
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.    
p224
tp225
a(V KRAMER 
p226
V Look at this place. It's huge...  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."   
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Where the hell is this car, Kramer?    
p236
tp237
a(V KRAMER 
p238
V It's got to be here.  
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.   
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Maybe it's not on this level.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V What?  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?   
p251
tp252
a(V ELAINE 
p253
V It felt like a couple of levels.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V You should always carry a pad and pen. GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.   
p257
tp258
a(V KRAMER 
p259
V I have a pen.   THEY REACT...   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."   
p263
tp264
a(V MOTHER 
p265
V Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?   
p266
tp267
a(V ELAINE 
p268
V Look at that woman.   SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.   
p269
tp270
a(V MOTHER 
p271
V I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.   
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Hey, is that necessary?  
p275
tp276
a(V MOTHER 
p277
V Why don't you mind your own business?    
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.   
p281
tp282
a(V KID 
p283
V You're ugly.  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V ...What?  
p287
tp288
a(V KID 
p289
V You're ugly.  
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V You are!  
p293
tp294
a(V KID 
p295
V You are!   THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED.   
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.   
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V (RE CAR) I found it!  
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V He's got it.  
p305
tp306
a(V KRAMER 
p307
V Oh...no.  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?   
p311
tp312
a(V ELAINE 
p313
V Jerry, look at my fish.   JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER.   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V His eyes look a little cloudy.  
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V Oh are they gonna be furious.  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!    
p323
tp324
a(V KRAMER 
p325
V It was easy the last time.  
p326
tp327
a(V ELAINE 
p328
V My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.   
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V No one's going to do that.   ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.    
p332
tp333
a(V ELAINE 
p334
V Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.    MAN #1  ...Sorry.  
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V Five minutes.   MAN #1  Can't do it.  
p338
tp339
a(V ELAINE 
p340
V We're not wilding.   THEY LEAVE.   
p341
tp342
a(V ELAINE 
p343
V Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...     THEY START LAUGHING.   
p344
tp345
a(V ELAINE 
p346
V Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny - These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?    THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.    
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?   
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V Right here at the mall.   BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD.   
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V Excuse me...   HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING.   
p356
tp357
a(V ELAINE 
p358
V Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.     CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.   
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.    
p362
tp363
a(V KRAMER 
p364
V You drank a whole bottle of water.    
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V I know.  
p368
tp369
a(V KRAMER 
p370
V So why don't you just go?  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V No I can't.  
p374
tp375
a(V KRAMER 
p376
V Don't you get tired of following rules?    
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V You think I'm too cautious?  
p380
tp381
a(V KRAMER 
p382
V Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.   
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.  
p386
tp387
a(V KRAMER 
p388
V Buddy Hackett?  
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V He's a comedian.  
p392
tp393
a(V KRAMER 
p394
V I know.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V All right. All right.  
p398
tp399
a(V KRAMER 
p400
V (pointing) You can go over here.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V I can manage.  
p404
tp405
a(V KRAMER 
p406
V (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)    KRAMER It'll take you ten seconds.   HE NUDGES JERRY.   
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Okay, okay. I'll be right back.   WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND  LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS  AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.     SECURITY GUARD  Okay, let's go. Come with me.  
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V But...   SECURITY GUARD  Come on.  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V ...Kramer   INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE   
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.     SECURITY GUARD  Well you're still not allowed.  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?    SECURITY GUARD  That's up to you.  
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V So you don't care if I die.   SECURITY GUARD  What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.   
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V It was life and death.   SECURITY GUARD  Uh huh.  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.    SECURITY GUARD  I don't know.  
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.   
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.    SECURITY GUARD  You can tell the police all about it.     INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE, KRAMER, AND ELAINE.

a(V ELAINE 
p442
V Jerry!  
p443
tp444
a(V GEORGE 
p445
V Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.   
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.   
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.   
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.    
p455
tp456
a(V ELAINE 
p457
V No, no, I'll be back.   SHE LEAVES.   
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.   
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V Does that bother you?  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE 
p466
V Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?   
p467
tp468
a(V KRAMER 
p469
V Not at all.  
p470
tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?   
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.   
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD.

V First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.     SECURITY GUARD  I know what you did.  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.    
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.     SECURITY GUARD  Yeah I'm sure.

V But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?    MAN #1  No, I wouldn't.     INT. SECURITY SHACK - JERRY (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.

V Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
