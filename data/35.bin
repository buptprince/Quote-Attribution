V  THE LIMO  Written by Larry Charles     (Comedy club)   Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea   what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just   feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything   they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it;   go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a   huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's   supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals,   the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating   that you're taking on the tuna.    George is at the airport.   It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman   beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?   The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.

V Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?    
p5
tp6
a(V MAN 
p7
V There's a clock over there.  
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V Where?  
p11
tp12
a(V MAN 
p13
V There.  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V But you have a watch on.  
p17
tp18
a(V MAN 
p19
V It's right by the escalator.  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V Why don't you just look at your watch?    
p23
tp24
a(V MAN 
p25
V I told you, it's right over there.    
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Let me see the watch.   George grabs the man's wrist.  
p29
tp30
a(V MAN 
p31
V Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!    
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V You know we're living in a society!     Jerry walks up from the ramp.  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V George.  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Jerry. Jerry.  
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?   
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.    Jerry, Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.   
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,   like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.    
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V So you have no car?  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V No.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V So what good are you?   Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says  O'BRIEN   
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,   O'Brien's not showing up.  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V How do you know?  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the   plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.   
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V We should take his limo.  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Yeah, right.  
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you   see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in   Chicago.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V He's definitely in Chicago.  
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V Well the guy's just standing there.    
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V How would we do it?  
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."   
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V Maybe he knows O'Brien?  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a   sign. Let's just do it.  
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V What if we get caught?  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.   
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V Who's gonna be O'Brien?  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V I'll be O'Brien.  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY

tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Okay.  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V What, you don't want to be you?  
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V Like who?  
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V Dylan Murphy.   George mumbles something.  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?    
p137
tp138
a(V GEORGE 
p139
V Well I like Dylan.  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142

a(V JERRY 
p148
V I'm Dylan Murphy.

a(V GEORGE 
p151

p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V Are we really doing this?  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Come on,

tp171
a(V CHAUFFER 
p172
V Here let me take that for you.  
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V Oh thank you.  
p176
tp177
a(V CHAUFFER 
p178
V I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.   
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V Thank you very much. Dylan?  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Colin?     George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.   
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done   in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V What for?  
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am.   In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you   now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop   it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm   *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V She happy for you?  
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V Can he hear us?  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V No. Why?  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.   
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V He can't hear us.  
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up   your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.    
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my   house?  
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you   dropping us?  
p218
tp219
a(V CHAUFFER 
p220
V Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.   
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to    Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago!   The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V What?  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V We're going to the Knick game!  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!   
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait,   you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see   things as they are? What do you say when you see things?  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'   
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I   have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden.   Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at   seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right   babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I   can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens   partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.    
p251
tp252
a(V CHAUFFER 
p253
V I know.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY AND GEORGE 
p256
V He knows?  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Maybe it's a shortcut.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.   
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?    
p269
tp270
a(V CHAUFFER 
p271
V Pick up the other members of your party.    
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other   members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we   were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.   
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V It was a good jig.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now?   They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.   
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.   
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V Well you should have been O'Brien.    
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?   
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V Yes, you have to be Murphy.  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.    
p302
tp303
a(V GEORGE 
p304
V You're Murphy!  
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V I'm Seinfeld!  
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.   
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V We're doing sixty miles an hour!  
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.    
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Who are you, Mannix?  
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V We're slowing down. Are those the people?    
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.    The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.   
p326
tp327
a(V WOMAN 
p328
V Mr. O'Brien?  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.   
p332
tp333
a(V EVA 
p334
V Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather   excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his   newsletter.  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Newsletter?  
p338
tp339
a(V TIM 
p340
V And of course, his great book, "The Game".   
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never   uh, met him before?  
p344
tp345
a(V EVA 
p346
V No.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V Never seen a picture of him?  
p350
tp351
a(V EVA 
p352
V Never.  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V Not even on the book jacket?  
p356
tp357
a(V EVA 
p358
V There was no picture on the book jacket.    
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.   
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V Hello. I'm O'Brien.     Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.  
p365
tp366
a(V KRAMER 
p367
V Hey!  
p368
tp369
a(V ELAINE 
p370
V Hey!  
p371
tp372
a(V KRAMER 
p373
V What, you took a cab?  
p374
tp375
a(V ELAINE 
p376
V Yeah? So?  
p377
tp378
a(V KRAMER 
p379
V How much do you make?  
p380
tp381
a(V ELAINE 
p382
V I'm not telling you.  
p383
tp384
a(V KRAMER 
p385
V C'mon.  
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V No!  
p389
tp390
a(V KRAMER 
p391
V I'll tell you how much I make.  
p392
tp393
a(V ELAINE 
p394
V I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I   don't even like basketball.  
p395
tp396
a(V KRAMER 
p397
V You ever seen Michael Jordan?  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V Just in those commercials.  
p401
tp402
a(V KRAMER 
p403
V Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.   
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V What's that?  
p407
tp408
a(V KRAMER 
p409
V Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.   
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V Huh?  
p413
tp414
a(V KRAMER 
p415
V Yeah.   Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of garbage   cans.    Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.   
p419
tp420
a(V TIM 
p421
V You think someone's been tipped off?    
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?   
p425
tp426
a(V EVA 
p427
V Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.   
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman   thinks of "The Big Game".  
p431
tp432
a(V EVA 
p433
V Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you    analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me   breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.   
p437
tp438
a(V TIM 
p439
V Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the   epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.   
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V He tends to exaggerate.  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V Okay, I mean it's serious but--  
p449
tp450
a(V EVA 
p451
V We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.   
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V Uh, my speech?  
p455
tp456
a(V EVA 
p457
V Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?   
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Well you might as well look it over.      Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.  
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V So what's going on, how did all this happen?   
p464
tp465
a(V ELAINE 
p466
V Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going    to the Knicks-Bulls game.  
p467
tp468
a(V KRAMER 
p469
V Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.   
p470
tp471
a(V ELAINE 
p472
V He did.  
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?   
p476
tp477
a(V ELAINE 
p478
V I don't know.  
p479
tp480
a(V KRAMER 
p481
V That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?   
p482
tp483
a(V ELAINE 
p484
V Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them   O'Brien and Murphy.  
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?     Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.    
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied   government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white   minority communities.  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V You're not going to open with that, are you?   
p494
tp495
a(V EVA 
p496
V What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?   
p497
tp498
a(V GEORGE 
p499
V I said so many things.   Suddenly they hear a loud bang.  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V They're shooting! They're shooting!    
p503
tp504
a(V TIM 
p505
V Alright, get down!   The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has   fallen on top of George.   Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.  
p506
tp507
a(V GEORGE 
p508
V That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.   
p509
tp510
a(V EVA 
p511
V But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.    Tim returns.  
p512
tp513
a(V TIM 
p514
V Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're    prepared to handle anything that might come up.   Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling   it sensually.  
p515
tp516

V Nice looking Lugar.     Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

a(V JODI 
p520
V I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden    where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to   protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the   midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most   charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent   overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf   Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a   full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is   in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but   quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional   fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi   Baskerville, back to you in the studio.    Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.

a(V KRAMER 
p523
V Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry.   They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be   called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?   A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized   Elaine.  
p524

a(V DAN 
p526
V Elaine?  
p527
tp528
a(V ELAINE 
p529
V Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?  
p530
tp531
a(V DAN 
p532
V Good.  
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.  
p536
tp537
a(V DAN 
p538
V Oh, Kramer?   They shake hands.  
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V What's going on?  
p542
tp543
a(V DAN 
p544
V Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of   the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.   
p545
tp546
a(V ELAINE 
p547
V Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.   
p548
tp549
a(V DAN 
p550
V Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.   
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.    
p554
tp555
a(V DAN 
p556
V Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time    he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.   
p557
tp558
a(V KRAMER 
p559
V Who?  
p560
tp561
a(V DAN 
p562
V The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.      Cut back to the limo. Jerry and George are alone inside.  
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V What's taking him so long out there?    
p566
tp567
a(V GEORGE 
p568
V Didja see the way she was looking at me?   
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!  
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.   
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?   
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V I don't know.  
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V Let's just make a run for it.  
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.    
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V How'd that happen?  
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real    tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out   and I pulled it.  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your   feet like that.  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.     George grabs the phone and dials.  
p599
tp600
a(V GEORGE 
p601
V 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah   listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--   Tim re-enters the limo.  
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The   Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.   
p605
tp606
a(V TIM 
p607
V We'll be ready in a minute.  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle   of something.  
p611
tp612
a(V TIM 
p613
V With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.   
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?   
p617
tp618
a(V TIM 
p619
V You are.  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular   again?  
p623
tp624
a(V TIM 
p625
V You are.  
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V Good. I think you forgot something.    
p629
tp630
a(V TIM 
p631
V I'm sorry.  
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V Good. Now get out.   Tim leaves.  
p635
tp636
a(V GEORGE 
p637
V Okay, what are we gonna do?  
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V I don't know.  
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see    Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.   
p644
tp645
a(V JERRY 
p646
V Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.     Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.  
p647
tp648
a(V KRAMER 
p649
V I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.   
p650
tp651
a(V ELAINE 
p652
V I'm sure he was just joking around.    
p653
tp654
a(V KRAMER 
p655
V Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,   Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!   
p656
tp657
a(V ELAINE 
p658
V What is it?  
p659
tp660
a(V KRAMER 
p661
V Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry,   always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo?   The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same   person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!  
p662
tp663
a(V ELAINE 
p664
V Jerry's a nazi?!  
p665
tp666
a(V KRAMER 
p667
V I can't believe I didn't see it.  
p668
tp669
a(V ELAINE 
p670
V Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.   
p671
tp672
a(V KRAMER 
p673
V You don't think so.  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V No, he's just neat.    Cut back to the limo.  
p677
tp678
a(V TIM 
p679
V You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.   
p680
tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V Me??   George and Jerry laugh nervously.  
p683
tp684
a(V TIM 
p685
V And you really don't look like a Murphy.    
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.   
p689
tp690
a(V GEORGE 
p691
V He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.   
p692
tp693
a(V TIM 
p694
V Where are you from?  
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen.   Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country   though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.  
p698
tp699
a(V TIM 
p700
V Sounds more like Scottish.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V We were right on the border.    Cut back to the street corner.  
p704
tp705
a(V KRAMER 
p706
V Maybe he's with the company.  
p707
tp708
a(V ELAINE 
p709
V What?  
p710
tp711
a(V KRAMER 
p712
V The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization   from within.  
p713
tp714
a(V ELAINE 
p715
V What about his comedy act?  
p716
tp717
a(V KRAMER 
p718
V That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's   too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.   
p719
tp720
a(V ELAINE 
p721
V What about George?  
p722
tp723
a(V KRAMER 
p724
V What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise.   No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with   the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt   and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed   Kennedy!  
p725
tp726
a(V ELAINE 
p727
V I'll bet they were even in on it.  
p728
tp729
a(V KRAMER 
p730
V Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs   and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.  
p731
tp732
a(V ELAINE 
p733
V Kramer, you're hurting me!    Quick cut to the now approaching limo.  
p734
tp735
a(V GEORGE 
p736
V Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to   them, pull over.  
p737
tp738
a(V ELAINE 
p739
V Get off of me!!   The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.  
p740
tp741
a(V KRAMER 
p742
V O'Brien.   This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus   stop.  
p743
tp744
a(V MAN 
p745
V O'Brien? Is that him?   MAN #2  Yeah, that's him.   MAN #3  Look there's O'Brien!   MAN #4  Filthy nazi bastard!   ALL FOUR  Let's get him!!   They begin running full speed towards the gang.  
p746
tp747
a(V GEORGE 
p748
V What do I do?! What do I do?!  
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V Get in the car! Get in the car!   George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.   
p752
tp753
a(V KRAMER 
p754
V O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?   
p755
tp756
a(V TIM 
p757
V Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?   
p758
tp759
a(V JERRY 
p760
V No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.    
p761
tp762
a(V ELAINE 
p763
V It could be very confusing.   The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.  
p764
tp765
a(V KRAMER 
p766
V Yeah? Eva?  
p767
tp768
a(V EVA 
p769
V It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.   
p770
tp771
a(V KRAMER 
p772
V O'Brien? Well that's weird.  
p773
tp774
a(V EVA 
p775
V Who are you?   George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke   down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.    Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.  
p776
tp777
a(V JODI 
p778
V A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of    protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.   Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three   are intelligible at this point.  
p779
tp780
a(V JODI 
p781
V They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem   unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be   having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public   appearance.   Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less   understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming   unnerved.  
p782
tp783
a(V EVA 
p784
V Get out!!  
p785
tp786
a(V ELAINE 
p787
V Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!  
p788
tp789
a(V DAN 
p790
V Elaine?  
p791
tp792
a(V ELAINE 
p793
V Hey!    Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD   O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.
