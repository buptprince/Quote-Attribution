V  THE LIBRARY  Written by Larry Charles     (JERRY'S APARTMENT)    Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book    from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?

V What's the problem?  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer    in 1971 and never returned it.  
p14
tp15
a(V KRAMER 
p16
V Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's    going to be $50,000  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V It doesn't work like that.

V If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000    
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly     because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. It was the first time I    ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this    body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...    FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)    
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY

V That orange dress is burned in my memory

a(V JERRY

V Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is    completely ridiculous.   (buzzer)

a(V KRAMER

tp81
a(V KRAMER 
p82
V Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster.  ...    Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was    a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding.    She needs a little Kramer.

a(V ELAINE

V How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?    Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.    Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.

V I don't know anything.  
p224
tp225
a(V ELAINE

V Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's     something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."    LIPPMAN ENTERS

p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because     I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?

tp255
a(V ELAINE 
p256
V What did he do?  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say,     "Can't stand ja".   "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.    
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps    were hangin' down by his ,...  
p263

V OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.

p292
V Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.   
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE

V He got fired the next day.  
p311
tp312
a(V ELAINE 
p313
V Why do they call it a wedgie?  
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..   
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the     waistband on top of the head. Very rare.

V Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library     he's waiting for ya.     STANDUP ROUTINE    What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take    out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done.    It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little    kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's    what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody    kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late.    ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?     JERRY'S APARTMENT

a(V BOOKMAN

V Yeah. Coffee.

V No, I don't drink coffee.  
p347

a(V BOOKMAN

p362
tp363
a(V JERRY

V I don't.  
p365
tp366
a(V BOOKMAN 
p367
V You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you    forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts    forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V Really? I'll have to remember that.    
p371
tp372
a(V BOOKMAN 
p373
V You took this book out in 1971.  
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V Yes, and I returned it in 1971.  
p377
tp378
a(V BOOKMAN 
p379
V Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries.    Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman     telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of    his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But    you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public     Library, fella.  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very    specifically.

a(V BOOKMAN 
p391
V You think this is all a big joke, don't you?   
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V No, I don't.  
p395
tp396
a(V BOOKMAN 
p397
V I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked     it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity    that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?   
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Certainly not.  
p401
tp402
a(V BOOKMAN 
p403
V Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp,    the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean    anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.     Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're    thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library     books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without    libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change    the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right    now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees    and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?     Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue     fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that     that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and     is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!
