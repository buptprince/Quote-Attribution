aV   GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld   (Comedy club)   You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. (imitates one of these people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone) "Did you ring?, I can't find him." (imitates other person on phone) "Where did he go?" (the first person again) "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.      (Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.)

aV Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George's shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.    
p6
aa(lp7
V GEORGE 
p8
aV Are you through? (kind of irritated)    
p9
aa(lp10
V JERRY 
p11
aV You do of course try on, when you buy?    
p12
aa(lp13
V GEORGE 
p14
aV Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.    
p15
aa(lp16
V JERRY 
p17
aV Oh, you don't recall?  
p18
aa(lp19
V GEORGE 
p20
aV (pretends he's talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.   
p21
aa(lp22
V JERRY 
p23
aV Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)    
p24
aa(lp25
V WAITRESS 
p26
aV Mister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)    
p27
aa(lp28
V GEORGE 
p29
aV Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?   
p30
aa(lp31
V WAITRESS 
p32
aV It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. (ironically)   
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.    
p36
aa(lp37
V WAITRESS 
p38
aV Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)   
p39
aa(lp40
V GEORGE 
p41
aV How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?   
p42
aa(lp43
V JERRY 
p44
aV Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.   
p45
aa(lp46
V GEORGE 
p47
aV Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?   
p48
aa(lp49
V JERRY 
p50
aV I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?   
p51
aa(lp52
V GEORGE 
p53
aV No, you didn't!  
p54
aa(lp55
V JERRY 
p56
aV I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There's no milk in here, what...   
p57
aa(lp58
V GEORGE 
p59
aV Wait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?   
p60
aa(lp61
V JERRY 
p62
aV Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.   
p63
aa(lp64
V GEORGE 
p65
aV (with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?   
p66
aa(lp67
V JERRY 
p68
aV Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.   
p69
aa(lp70
V GEORGE 
p71
aV Oh, nothing happened, but it was...    
p72
aa(lp73
V JERRY 
p74
aV Yeah.  
p75
aa(lp76
V GEORGE 
p77
aV This is great!  
p78
aa(lp79
V JERRY 
p80
aV Yeah.  
p81
aa(lp82
V GEORGE 
p83
aV So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!   
p84
aa(lp85
V JERRY 
p86
aV Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.   
p87
aa(lp88
V GEORGE 
p89
aV (whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?   
p90
aa(lp91
V JERRY 
p92
aV Yeah, but...  
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?   
p96
aa(lp97
V JERRY 
p98
aV Yeah!  
p99
aa(lp100
V GEORGE 
p101
aV No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.   
p102
aa(lp103
V JERRY 
p104
aV (indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?   
p105
aa(lp106
V GEORGE 
p107
aV How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.   
p108
aa(lp109
V JERRY 
p110
aV To be polite? You are insane!  
p111
aa(lp112
V GEORGE 
p113
aV All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?   
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV Yes!  
p117
aa(lp118
V GEORGE 
p119
aV You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!    
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV Oh, I get it, this is about the button.    
p123
aa(lp124
V GEORGE 
p125
aV (The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?   
p126
aa(lp127
V CLAIRE 
p128
aV What gave it away, George?  
p129
aa(lp130
V GEORGE 
p131
aV Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.    
p132
aa(lp133
V JERRY 
p134
aV (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?   
p135
aa(lp136
V GEORGE 
p137
aV (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent "has to") come to New York on business...   
p138
aa(lp139
V JERRY 
p140
aV Oh you are beautiful! (ironically)    
p141
aa(lp142
V GEORGE 
p143
aV and, and maybe (again some gestures) she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?   
p144
aa(lp145
V CLAIRE 
p146
aV I'd have to say: uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO)   
p147
aa(lp148
V GEORGE 
p149
aV (to Claire) So why did she call?  
p150
aa(lp151
V CLAIRE 
p152
aV To be polite.  
p153
aa(lp154
V GEORGE 
p155
aV To be polite, I rest my case.  
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.   
p159
aa(lp160
V GEORGE 
p161
aV I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.    
p162
aa(lp163
V JERRY 
p164
aV Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".    
p165
aa(lp166
V GEORGE 
p167
aV Come on, I'm tired.  
p168
aa(lp169
V CLAIRE 
p170
aV (to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.   
p171
aa(lp172
V GEORGE 
p173
aV (takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile)      (Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers)   
p174
aa(lp175
V GEORGE 
p176
aV Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)   
p177
aa(lp178
V JERRY 
p179
aV Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.   
p180
aa(lp181
V GEORGE 
p182
aV I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...    
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV And you didn't even hear how she sounded.    
p186
aa(lp187
V GEORGE 
p188
aV What?!  
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV Laura.  
p192
aa(lp193
V GEORGE 
p194
aV I can't believe: (falls on his knees)  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!   
p195
aa(lp196
V JERRY 
p197
aV Yeah, but how could you be so sure?    
p198
aa(lp199
V GEORGE 
p200
aV (gets up) 'Cause it's signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?    
p201
aa(lp202
V JERRY 
p203
aV No.  
p204
aa(lp205
V GEORGE 
p206
aV She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!   
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV Yeah.  
p210
aa(lp211
V GEORGE 
p212
aV What is that? It's ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!   
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV Maybe you're right.  
p216
aa(lp217
V GEORGE 
p218
aV Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.    
p219
aa(lp220
V JERRY 
p221
aV This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.    
p222
aa(lp223
V GEORGE 
p224
aV (puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?    
p225
aa(lp226
V JERRY 
p227
aV No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.    
p228
aa(lp229
V GEORGE 
p230
aV You're gonna "overdry" it.  
p231
aa(lp232
V JERRY 
p233
aV You, you can't "overdry".  
p234
aa(lp235
V GEORGE 
p236
aV Why not?  
p237
aa(lp238
V JERRY 
p239
aV Same as you can't "overwet". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".   
p240
aa(lp241
V GEORGE 
p242
aV (looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?   
p243
aa(lp244
V JERRY 
p245
aV How could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)   
p246
aa(lp247
V GEORGE 
p248
aV (points to the dryer) Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised)      (Comedy club)  
p249
aa(lp250
V JERRY 
p251
aV "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: (sock's voice) "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.      (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV)  
p252
aa(lp253
V JERRY 
p254
aV (The phone rings. He picks it up and says:) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)    
p255
aa(lp256
V KRAMER 
p257
aV (enters) Are you up?  
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV (To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).   
p261
aa(lp262
V KRAMER 
p263
aV Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?    
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY 
p266
aV (upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer" wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.   
p267
aa(lp268
V KRAMER 
p269
aV Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?    
p270
aa(lp271
V JERRY 
p272
aV (a little irritated) Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?   
p273
aa(lp274
V KRAMER 
p275
aV (still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.    
p276
aa(lp277
V JERRY 
p278
aV (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!   
p279
aa(lp280
V KRAMER 
p281
aV Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks:) Are you done with this?   
p282
aa(lp283
V JERRY 
p284
aV No.  
p285
aa(lp286
V KRAMER 
p287
aV (glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you're done, let me know.   
p288
aa(lp289
V JERRY 
p290
aV Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.    
p291
aa(lp292
V KRAMER 
p293
aV I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.   
p294
aa(lp295
V JERRY 
p296
aV No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.   
p297
aa(lp298
V KRAMER 
p299
aV You want me to talk to her?  
p300
aa(lp301
V JERRY 
p302
aV I don't think so.  
p303
aa(lp304
V KRAMER 
p305
aV Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)   
p306
aa(lp307
V JERRY 
p308
aV That close, huh?  
p309
aa(lp310
V KRAMER 
p311
aV You better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)   
p312
aa(lp313
V JERRY 
p314
aV Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.  
p315
aa(lp316
V KRAMER 
p317
aV Give me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).   
p318
aa(lp319
V JERRY 
p320
aV (gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on  TV)...   
p321
aa(lp322
V KRAMER 
p323
aV A SLIDE!...Wow!  
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer:) I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!      (Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress)    
p327
aa(lp328
V JERRY 
p329
aV If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.    
p330
aa(lp331
V GEORGE 
p332
aV Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)   
p333
aa(lp334
V JERRY 
p335
aV (hands George a beer) Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.   
p336
aa(lp337
V GEORGE 
p338
aV All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?   
p339
aa(lp340
V JERRY 
p341
aV All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...   
p342
aa(lp343
V GEORGE 
p344
aV A decent hotel-room...  
p345
aa(lp346
V JERRY 
p347
aV Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.   
p348
aa(lp349
V GEORGE 
p350
aV You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!      
p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY 
p353
aV (cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?    
p354
aa(lp355
V GEORGE 
p356
aV I think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)   
p357
aa(lp358
V KRAMER 
p359
aV (walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.    
p360
aa(lp361
V GEORGE 
p362
aV (ironically) Well, that's flattering.    
p363
aa(lp364
V KRAMER 
p365
aV (the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?   
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY 
p368
aV Yeah.  
p369
aa(lp370
V KRAMER 
p371
aV Why even give her an option?  
p372
aa(lp373
V JERRY 
p374
aV This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".   
p375
aa(lp376
V GEORGE 
p377
aV Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.   
p378
aa(lp379
V JERRY 
p380
aV Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.   
p381
aa(lp382
V GEORGE 
p383
aV So what? That's good.  
p384
aa(lp385
V JERRY 
p386
aV Now, how could that be good?  
p387
aa(lp388
V GEORGE 
p389
aV Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.    
p390
aa(lp391
V JERRY 
p392
aV This is how you operate?  
p393
aa(lp394
V GEORGE 
p395
aV Yeah, I wish.  
p396
aa(lp397
V JERRY 
p398
aV Let me just wipe the sink.  
p399
aa(lp400
V KRAMER 
p401
aV (stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It's unbelievable.   
p402
aa(lp403
V GEORGE 
p404
aV Yeah.  
p405
aa(lp406
V KRAMER 
p407
aV ...How's the real estate-business?

aV ...(surprised he asked) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.   
p411

V KRAMER 
p413
aV Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?   
p414
aa(lp415
V GEORGE 
p416
aV Well, I might be getting in to that.    
p417

aV (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!   
p420

V GEORGE 
p422
aV I'm aware of you, all right, let's go (opens the bathroom door), let's go! (Jerry and the dog come out) You're on stage in 25 minutes.      (Comedy club.)

aV The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".      (Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura)

p428
aV Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?   
p429
aa(lp430
V GEORGE 
p431
aV What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.    
p432
aa(lp433
V JERRY 
p434
aV Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.   
p435
aa(lp436
V GEORGE 
p437
aV Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.    
p438
aa(lp439
V JERRY 
p440
aV Really? How?  
p441
aa(lp442
V GEORGE 
p443
aV 'Cause it's all in the greeting.  
p444
aa(lp445
V JERRY 
p446
aV Uh-huh.  
p447
aa(lp448
V GEORGE 
p449
aV All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.   
p450
aa(lp451
V JERRY 
p452
aV Right.  
p453
aa(lp454
V GEORGE 
p455
aV Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.   
p456
aa(lp457
V JERRY 
p458
aV "Lip-area".  
p459
aa(lp460
V GEORGE 
p461
aV Ya know a hug: definitely good.  
p462
aa(lp463
V JERRY 
p464
aV Hug is definitely good.  
p465
aa(lp466
V GEORGE 
p467
aV Sure.  
p468
aa(lp469
V JERRY 
p470
aV Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?   
p471
aa(lp472
V GEORGE 
p473
aV That's so brutal, I hate that.  
p474
aa(lp475
V JERRY 
p476
aV Ya know how they do that?  
p477
aa(lp478
V GEORGE 
p479
aV That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.    
p480
aa(lp481
V JERRY 
p482
aV Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?    
p483
aa(lp484
V GEORGE 
p485
aV Hand-sandwich.  
p486
aa(lp487
V JERRY 
p488
aV Right.  
p489
aa(lp490
V GEORGE 
p491
aV I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...(suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes)   
p492
aa(lp493
V LAURA 
p494
aV Guess who?

V JERRY 
p533
aV (privately to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?   
p534
aa(lp535
V GEORGE 
p536
aV Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.       (Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment)  
p537
aa(lp538
V JERRY 
p539
aV So uh, what do ya think?  
p540
aa(lp541
V LAURA 
p542
aV Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.    
p543
aa(lp544
V JERRY 
p545
aV Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?    
p546
aa(lp547
V LAURA 
p548
aV (laughs) Actually uhm, do you have any wine?    JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.  
p549
aa(lp550
V LAURA 
p551
aV Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? (points to the lamp)   
p552
aa(lp553
V JERRY 
p554
aV Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. (she turns down the lamp)   
p555
aa(lp556
V LAURA 
p557
aV Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?    
p558
aa(lp559
V JERRY 
p560
aV Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?   
p561
aa(lp562
V LAURA 
p563
aV No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.   
p564
aa(lp565
V JERRY 
p566
aV Really? What would you like to do?    
p567
aa(lp568
V LAURA 
p569
aV Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.    
p570
aa(lp571
V JERRY 
p572
aV (doubtfully) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pours the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. (the phone rings; he picks it up) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Uhm, it's for you.   
p573
aa(lp574

Never get engaged.   
p576
aa(lp577
V JERRY 
p578
aV You're engaged?  
p579
aa(lp580
V LAURA 
p581
aV You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.    
p582
aa(lp583
V JERRY 
p584
aV You're engaged? (still can't believe it)   
p585
aa(lp586
V LAURA 
p587
aV Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.    
p588
aa(lp589
V JERRY 
p590
aV You're engaged! (like he's answering his own question)   
p591
aa(lp592
V LAURA

aV Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...  
p594
aa(lp595

aV Yeah.
