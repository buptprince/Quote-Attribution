V   GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld   (Comedy club)   You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. (imitates one of these people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone) "Did you ring?, I can't find him." (imitates other person on phone) "Where did he go?" (the first person again) "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.      (Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.)

V Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George's shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.    
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V Are you through? (kind of irritated)    
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V You do of course try on, when you buy?    
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.    
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Oh, you don't recall?  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V (pretends he's talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.   
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)    
p23
tp24
a(V WAITRESS 
p25
V Mister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)    
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?   
p29
tp30
a(V WAITRESS 
p31
V It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. (ironically)   
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.    
p35
tp36
a(V WAITRESS 
p37
V Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)   
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?   
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.   
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?   
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?   
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V No, you didn't!  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There's no milk in here, what...   
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V Wait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?   
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.   
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V (with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?   
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.   
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Oh, nothing happened, but it was...    
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Yeah.  
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V This is great!  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V Yeah.  
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!   
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.   
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V (whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?   
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V Yeah, but...  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Yeah!  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.   
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V (indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?   
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.   
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V To be polite? You are insane!  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?   
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Yes!  
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!    
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Oh, I get it, this is about the button.    
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V (The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?   
p125
tp126
a(V CLAIRE 
p127
V What gave it away, George?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.    
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?   
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent "has to") come to New York on business...   
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Oh you are beautiful! (ironically)    
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V and, and maybe (again some gestures) she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?   
p143
tp144
a(V CLAIRE 
p145
V I'd have to say: uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO)   
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V (to Claire) So why did she call?  
p149
tp150
a(V CLAIRE 
p151
V To be polite.  
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V To be polite, I rest my case.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.   
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.    
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".    
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V Come on, I'm tired.  
p167
tp168
a(V CLAIRE 
p169
V (to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.   
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V (takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile)      (Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers)   
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)   
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.   
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...    
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V And you didn't even hear how she sounded.    
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V What?!  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V Laura.  
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V I can't believe: (falls on his knees)  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!   
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Yeah, but how could you be so sure?    
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V (gets up) 'Cause it's signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?    
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V No.  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!   
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Yeah.  
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V What is that? It's ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Maybe you're right.  
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.    
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.    
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V (puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?    
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.    
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V You're gonna "overdry" it.  
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V You, you can't "overdry".  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Why not?  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Same as you can't "overwet". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".   
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V (looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?   
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V How could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)   
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V (points to the dryer) Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised)      (Comedy club)  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: (sock's voice) "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.      (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV)  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V (The phone rings. He picks it up and says:) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)    
p254
tp255
a(V KRAMER 
p256
V (enters) Are you up?  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V (To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).   
p260
tp261
a(V KRAMER 
p262
V Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?    
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V (upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer" wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.   
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?    
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V (a little irritated) Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?   
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V (still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.    
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!   
p278
tp279
a(V KRAMER 
p280
V Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks:) Are you done with this?   
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V No.  
p284
tp285
a(V KRAMER 
p286
V (glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you're done, let me know.   
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.    
p290
tp291
a(V KRAMER 
p292
V I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.   
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.   
p296
tp297
a(V KRAMER 
p298
V You want me to talk to her?  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V I don't think so.  
p302
tp303
a(V KRAMER 
p304
V Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)   
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V That close, huh?  
p308
tp309
a(V KRAMER 
p310
V You better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)   
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.  
p314
tp315
a(V KRAMER 
p316
V Give me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).   
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V (gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on  TV)...   
p320
tp321
a(V KRAMER 
p322
V A SLIDE!...Wow!  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer:) I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!      (Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress)    
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.    
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)   
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V (hands George a beer) Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.   
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?   
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...   
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V A decent hotel-room...  
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.   
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!      
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V (cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?    
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V I think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)   
p356
tp357
a(V KRAMER 
p358
V (walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.    
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V (ironically) Well, that's flattering.    
p362
tp363
a(V KRAMER 
p364
V (the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Yeah.  
p368
tp369
a(V KRAMER 
p370
V Why even give her an option?  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.   
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.   
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V So what? That's good.  
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Now, how could that be good?  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.    
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V This is how you operate?  
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V Yeah, I wish.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Let me just wipe the sink.  
p398
tp399
a(V KRAMER 
p400
V (stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It's unbelievable.   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V Yeah.  
p404
tp405
a(V KRAMER 
p406
V ...How's the real estate-business?    
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V ...(surprised he asked) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.   
p410
tp411
a(V KRAMER 
p412
V Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?   
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415

V The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".      (Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura)

V Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?   
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.    
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.   
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.    
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V Really? How?  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V 'Cause it's all in the greeting.  
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V Uh-huh.  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.   
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V Right.  
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.   
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V "Lip-area".  
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Ya know a hug: definitely good.  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V Hug is definitely good.  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE 
p466
V Sure.  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?   
p470
tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V That's so brutal, I hate that.  
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V Ya know how they do that?  
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.    
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?    
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V Hand-sandwich.  
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V Right.  
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...(suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes)

a(V JERRY 
p532
V (privately to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?   
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.       (Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment)  
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V So uh, what do ya think?  
p539

a(V LAURA 
p541
V Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.    
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?    
p545
tp546
a(V LAURA 
p547
V (laughs) Actually uhm, do you have any wine?    JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.  
p548
tp549
a(V LAURA 
p550
V Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? (points to the lamp)   
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. (she turns down the lamp)   
p554
tp555
a(V LAURA 
p556
V Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?    
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?   
p560
tp561
a(V LAURA 
p562
V No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.   
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V Really? What would you like to do?    
p566
tp567
a(V LAURA 
p568
V Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.    
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V (doubtfully) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pours the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. (the phone rings; he picks it up) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Uhm, it's for you.   
p572
tp573
a(V LAURA 
p574
V (she takes the phone) Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye (she hangs up the phone). Never get engaged.   
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V You're engaged?  
p578
tp579
a(V LAURA 
p580
V You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.    
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V You're engaged? (still can't believe it)   
p584
tp585
a(V LAURA 
p586
V Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.    
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V You're engaged! (like he's answering his own question)   
p590
tp591
a(V LAURA

V Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...  
p593
