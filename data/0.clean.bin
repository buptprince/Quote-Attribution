Vjerry
p425
aVthe dating world is not a fun world it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, i gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. women need equipment. i don't know what they need. i know i don't have it, i know that ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. this is the one i'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me i have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? i've never had one i never bought one, i never needed one, i've never been in a situation, when i thought to myself i could use a cotton-ball right now i can certainly get out of this mess women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? they're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? what are you doin' with them? the only time i ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience tortured, interrogated, i don't know what happened to them i once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. i don't know what to do with them, i took them out, i put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. i thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town let's move on the dating world is a world of pressure. let's face it a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. the only difference between a date and a job-interview is not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it ya know well, bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with? .
p426
aa(lp427
Vjerry
p428
aVwouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?
p429
aa(lp430
Vgeorge
p431
aVwhat a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.
p432
aa(lp433
Vjerry
p434
aVya know, instead, i'm like a detective i've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
p435
aa(lp436
Vgeorge
p437
aVlisten, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
p438
aa(lp439
Vjerry
p440
aVreally? how?
p441
aa(lp442
Vgeorge
p443
