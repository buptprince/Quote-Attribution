V  THE BOYFRIEND PT 1  Written by Larry David & Larry Levin     (Comedy club)   To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're   working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the   strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only   reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the   workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have   to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get   about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and   smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym   clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he   has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think   about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks   you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.     (Gym Locker Room)   Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that   guy. You two were hogging the ball.

Whatever the   group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not   interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in   seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food.   They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or   someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of   potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid,   you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were   the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend,   they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump   up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like   Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!    (New York State Department of Labor)   MRS.

a(V ELAINE 
p457
V Wow! What a story.  
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise    of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as   I've heard this story a number of times.  
p461

a(V JERRY 
p463
V Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith   passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on   the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple   striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off   the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his   baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air   mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one   magic luggie.   (THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF  KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN   THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!)    
p464
tp465
a(V NEWMAN 
p466
V Well that's the way it happened.  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V What happened to your head when you got hit?   
p470
tp471
a(V KRAMER 
p472
V Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left   
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V Again  
p476
tp477
a(V KRAMER 
p478
V Back and to the left  
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V Back and to the left Back and to the left   
p482
tp483
a(V ELAINE 
p484
V So, what are you saying?  
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been   a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed   that would have caused your head to pitch forward.  
p488
tp489
a(V ELAINE 
p490
V So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.   
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V But that is not what they would have you believe.   
p494
tp495
a(V NEWMAN 
p496
V I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)    
p497

a(V JERRY 
p502
V The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.    (George runs in)  
p503
tp504
a(V GEORGE 
p505
V (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandaley industries?   
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V No. What happened to you?  
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close   to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone   rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".  
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V I'm Vanadaley Industries?  
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Right.

V And what is that?  
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V You're in latex  
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Latex? And what do I do with latex?    
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE

a(V JERRY 
p535
V And what do I say about you?  
p536
tp537
a(V GEORGE 
p538
V You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.   
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?    
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V Right.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V I don't think so. Why would I do that?    
p548
tp549
a(V GEORGE 
p550
V Because I asked you to.  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers    around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to   manufacture the stuff.   (Buzzer)  
p554
tp555
