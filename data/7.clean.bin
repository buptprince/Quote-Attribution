aVthe jacket written by larry david & jerry seinfeld i hate clothes, okay? i hate buying them. i hate picking them out of my closet. i can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. i think eventually fashion won't even exist. it won't. i think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'cause anytime i see a movie or a tv show where there's people from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. somehow they decided this is going to be our outfit. one-piece silver jumpsuit, v-stripe, and boots. that's it. we should come up for an outfit for earth. an earth outfit. we should vote on it. candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. they walk out, twirl, walk off. we just sit in the audience and go, that was nice. i could wear that.

p12
aa(lp13
Vjerry

p546
aa(lp547
Vjerry
p548
aVoh, you didn't
p549
aa(lp550
Velaine
p551
aVwell, he said he'd drive me here right after. so, i am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. i am freezing. then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. he's a city marshal. he's towing the car away. kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. he was going to tow it with me in the car! so, they tow the car. now, i am standing outside, and i am freezing, but i cannot leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car so, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. he said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. so, we're wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! now we're running down the street after these doves. i almost got hit by a bus. so how's everything going over here?
