aVthe ex-girlfriend written by larry david & jerry seinfeld i'm always in traffic with the lane expert. you know this type of person? constantly reevaluating their lane choice never quite sure, is this the best lane for me? for my life? they're always a little bit ahead of you, can i get in over there? could i get in over here? could i get in there? yeah, come on over here, pal. we're zoomin' over here. this is the secret lane, nobody knows about it the ultimate, i think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. not even rolling. and you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. so we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. i mean, what will happen? will it start moving backwords, i wonder? i mean, is that possible? that someday we'll be going boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. this, is really bad. i'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.

aVtell me if you think this is strange there's this guy who lives in my building, who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. he's a teacher, or something. anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little nothing much. little pleasantries. he was a nice guy, he's got a family then after a while, i noticed there was not more stopping. just saying hello and continuing on our way. polite nodding. then one day, he doesn't nod. like i don't exist?! he went from nods to nothing.
p120
aa(lp121

p123
aa(lp124
Velaine

Vjerry
p128
aVa relationship is an organism. you created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. same thing happened to the blob.
p129
aa(lp130

aVyou did it? what happened?
p219
aa(lp220
Vgeorge
p221
aVi told her. in the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. i started with the word listen.
p222
aa(lp223
Vjerry
p224
aVah ha.
p225
aa(lp226
Vgeorge
p227
aVi said, listen marlene, and then the next thing i know, i'm in the middle of it. and there's this voice inside of me going you're doing it! you're doing it! and then she started to cry, and i weakened a bit. i almost relented, but the voice, jerry. the voice said keep going, keep going. you're almost out! it's like i was making a prison break, you know. and i'm heading for the wall, and i trip and i twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. so, somehow i get the front door. i opened it up, i'm one foot away, i took one last look around the penitentiary, and i jumped!
p228
aa(lp229
Vjerry
p230
aVsee, it's never as bad as you imagine.
p231
aa(lp232
Vkramer
p233
aVi liked marlene. what's her number?
p234
aa(lp235
Vgeorge
p236
aVno, i, i don't think so.
p237
aa(lp238
Vjerry
p239
aVcould you stop that smacking?
p240
aa(lp241
Vkramer
p242
aVgeorge, i want you to taste this cantaloupe.
p243
aa(lp244
Vgeorge
p245

p246
aa(lp247
Vkramer
p248
aVit's the best cantaloupe i ever had.
p249
aa(lp250
Vgeorge
p251
aVno, really. no, no, thanks.
p252
aa(lp253
Vkramer
p254
aVjerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
p255
aa(lp256
Vjerry
p257
aVit's very good cantaloupe. so that's it? you're out?
p258
aa(lp259
Vgeorge
p260
aVexcept for one small problem. i left some books in her apartment.
p261
aa(lp262
Vjerry
p263
aVso, go get them.
p264
aa(lp265
Vgeorge
p266
aVoh, no. no, i can't go back there. jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. something could happen, i'd be right back where i started.
p267
aa(lp268
Vjerry
p269
aVso forget about the books. did you read them?
p270
aa(lp271
Vgeorge
p272
aVwell, yeah.
p273
aa(lp274
Vjerry
p275
aVwhat do you need them for?
p276
aa(lp277
Vgeorge
p278
aVi don't know. they're books.
p279
aa(lp280
Vjerry
p281
aVwhat is this obsession people have with books? they put them in their houses - like they're trophies. what do you need it for after you read it?
p282
aa(lp283
Vgeorge
p284
aVthey're my books.
p285
aa(lp286
Vjerry
p287
aVso you want me to get those books? is that it?
p288
aa(lp289
Vmarlene
p290
aVso, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. i was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. and i don't know, i was just in one of those moods - so i said to myself, marlene, just do it, and i jumped in. and as i'm getting out, i feel all these eyes on me, and i look up and everyone is just staring at me.
p291
aa(lp292
Vjerry
p293
aVso what'd you do?
p294
aa(lp295
Vmarlene
p296
aVwell, nothing. it's not skin off my hide if people like to look. i just didn't see what the big attraction was.
p297
aa(lp298
Vjerry
p299
aVwell, i have a general idea what it was. i could take a guess.
p300
aa(lp301
Vmarlene
p302
aVhey, you know, jerry, just because george and i don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.
p303
aa(lp304
Vjerry
p305
aVno.
p306
aa(lp307
Vmarlene
p308
aVgood enough. i'm really glad we got that settled.
p309
aa(lp310
Vjerry
p311
aVi don't know how this happened.
p312
aa(lp313
Vgeorge
p314
aVjerry, it's not my fault.
p315
aa(lp316
Vjerry
p317
aVno, no. it's not your fault. books, books, i need my books. have you re-read those books yet, by the way? you know the great thing? when you read moby dick the second time, ahab and the whale become good friends. you know, it's not like marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my god! i mean, we've had like three lunches and a movie. and she never stops calling. and it's these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. she never asks if i'm busy or anything. i just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.
p318
aa(lp319
Vgeorge
p320
aVthat's standard. has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
p321
aa(lp322
Vjerry
p323
aVohh you know, and sometimes she'll go, hello, jerry? and i'll go oh, hi marlene. and then it's jerry
p324
aa(lp325
Vgeorge
p326
aVwhat about getting off the phone?
p327
aa(lp328
Vjerry
p329
aVohhhh you can't. it's impossible. there's no break in the conversation where you can go, alright, then you know, it just goes on and on and on with out a break in the wall. i mean, i gotta put a stop to this.
p330
aa(lp331
Vgeorge
p332
aVjust do it like a band-aid. one motion, right off! she is sexy though. don't you think?
p333
aa(lp334
Vjerry
p335
aVyeah. yes, she is.
p336

p348
aa(lp349
Vi
p350
aVhate the little room. oh, hello, doctor.
p351
aa(lp352
Vjerry
p353
aVwaiting room. i hate when they make you wait in the room. 'cause it says waiting room. there's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting room, they're going to use it. they've got it. it's all set up for you to wait. and you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. you pretend you're reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. you know, you're thinking about about them things like i wonder what he's got. as soon as she goes, i'm getting her magazine. and then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. they finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. well, i guess i've been chosen. i'll see you all later. you know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? no. you're going into the next waiting room. the littler waiting room. but if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, i think. you don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. you know what i mean? you ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? you don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, i have to see this! are you kidding? are they really gonna do that to him? are there seats? can we get in? do they scalp tickets to these things? i got two for the winslow tumor, i got two
p354
aa(lp355
Vjerry
p356
aVso, how was it?
