V  THE TRIP PART 1  Written by Larry Charles      (George and Jerry enter Monk's Coffee Shop)   Kramer was on Murphy Brown?  
p2
tp3
a(V JERRY 
p4
V Yeah.  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V Are you sure?  
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Yeah.  
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V Murphy Brown, the TV show.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V C'mon, will ya?  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!   
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V Something, isn't it?  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V With Candace Bergen!  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V I know!  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?   
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Sure.  
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V Did she show her breasts in that?  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V She's not really the naked type.  
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him   to California.  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V He did?  
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V Yeah, I turned him down.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V How come you didn't tell me?  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V He asked me to keep it a secret.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V But you can never keep a secret.  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni   Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that   for about 28 seconds.  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Well, you've come a long way.  
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V I've matured.  
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do    the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna   go?  
p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V A free ticket?  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the   way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those   keys.  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V What about accommodations?  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V All taken care of.  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have   the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta   get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I   need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have   that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...     Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors.  
p86
tp87
a(V KRAMER 
p88
V So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with   color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to   the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines   have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way   I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of   emotions.   STUDIO GUARD  Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?   
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V Uh, did you?   STUDIO GUARD  C'mon, let's go.  
p92
tp93
a(V KRAMER 
p94
V Well, I was just--   STUDIO GUARD  Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.   
p95
tp96
a(V KRAMER 
p97
V Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?      Kramer's apartment building in LA. Singers and actors are heard practicing in   the background. Kramer leaves his apartment and makes a call on the pay phone   in the hall.  
p98
tp99
a(V VOICE 
p100
V Murphy Brown.  
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.    
p104
tp105
a(V VOICE 
p106
V Who's calling please?  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.     Dial tone.  
p110
tp111
a(V KRAMER 
p112
V Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him)   Go ahead, it's all yours.   Helena, a neighbor, steps into the hallway.  
p113
tp114
a(V HELENA 
p115
V Hello Kramer.  
p116
tp117
a(V KRAMER 
p118
V Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?  
p119
tp120
a(V HELENA 
p121
V I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?   
p122
tp123
a(V KRAMER 
p124
V Well, that's only uh, 58 years.  
p125
tp126
a(V HELENA 
p127
V It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's   secretary, remember?  
p128
tp129
a(V KRAMER 
p130
V Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?   
p131
tp132
a(V HELENA 
p133
V No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's   been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.  
p134
tp135
a(V KRAMER 
p136
V Uh huh, right.  
p137
tp138
a(V HELENA 
p139
V But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful   mistake.  
p140
tp141
a(V KRAMER 
p142
V Right.  
p143
tp144
a(V HELENA 
p145
V Moe hits Curly with an axe,  
p146
tp147
a(V KRAMER 
p148
V Uh huh.  
p149
tp150
a(V HELENA 
p151
V The Stooges catch the kidnappers,  
p152
tp153
a(V KRAMER 
p154
V Right.  
p155
tp156
a(V HELENA 
p157
V But it's too late.  
p158
tp159
a(V KRAMER 
p160
V Really.  
p161
tp162
a(V HELENA 
p163
V The baby's dead.  
p164
tp165
a(V KRAMER 
p166
V Really?  
p167
tp168
a(V HELENA 
p169
V The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.   
p170
tp171
a(V KRAMER 
p172
V Well I don't remember that part.  
p173
tp174
a(V HELENA 
p175
V I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.  
p176
tp177
a(V KRAMER 
p178
V Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.   
p179
tp180
a(V HELENA 
p181
V Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the   Stooges being executed and all.  
p182
tp183
a(V KRAMER 
p184
V Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.   
p185
tp186
a(V HELENA 
p187
V Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?    
p188
tp189
a(V KRAMER 
p190
V Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very   big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I   guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?  
p191
tp192
a(V HELENE 
p193
V Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll   destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,   
p194
tp195
a(V KRAMER 
p196
V Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.   
p197
tp198
a(V HELENA 
p199
V I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer!   Kramer!      Jerry's apartment. George walks in with several stuffed suitcases and   backpacks.  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V What is this?  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V What?  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V I happen to dress based on mood.  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.   
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many   subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many   moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V (referring to George's outfit): And what mood is this.   
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V This is Morning Mist.      A murder scene. There's a body under a blanket and two Lieutenants are talking.    LT. COLEMAN  What do you figure, 20? 21?   LT. MARTEL  Close enough.   LT. COLEMAN  Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.    LT. MARTEL  No ID?   LT. COLEMAN  No ID.   LT. MARTEL  No witnesses?   LT. COLEMAN  Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.    LT. MARTEL  She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.    LT. COLEMAN  Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?    LT. MARTEL  I don't know, but I don't like it.        Jerry and George are at the airport, in line for the metal detector.    
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through   real slow the machine won't detect him.  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm   afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.  
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V Just go.   George braces himself and walks through the detector.  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Heh he, I made it.   Jerry walks through and the machine beeps.   SECURITY GUARD  Empty your pockets please.   Jerry empties his pockets and walks through again, the machine beeps again.    SECURITY GUARD  Walk through again please.   Jerry walks through, the machine beeps again.   SECURITY GUARD  Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets?   Rings? Anklets?  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Anklets?   SECURITY GUARD  A lot of men wear anklets.  
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V Really?   SECURITY GUARD  Yeah.   OTHER SECURITY GUARD  What do you have in your bag, sir?    
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V My bag?   SECURITY GUARD  Step over here please.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Over here?   OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Do you have a knife in the bag?  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V A knife?   OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Open the bag, please.   George opens his bag, the other security guard begins rummaging.     OTHER SECURITY GUARD  What's this?  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Moisturizer?   OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Your wife?  
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V No, I uh... I use it.   SECURITY GUARD  Spread your arms and legs please.   The security guard begins waving a small beeping detector up and down Jerry's   body.  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.   OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Have a good trip.   SECURITY GUARD  Alright, go ahead.  
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V That's it?   SECURITY GUARD  That's it.  
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Alright.  
p266
tp267
a(V GEORGE 
p268
V C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?   
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V I must have iron rich blood.  
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Here we go, LA.  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V The Coast,  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?    
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V Who said that?  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V I called it.  
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Oh no.     Monologue, Jerry on stage.   Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America are the people   that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate   these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart   people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh!   It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people,   Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow   and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel.   The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and   then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated   pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?       Stock photo of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Cut to a casting office. Kramer enters.   
p290
tp291
a(V KRAMER 
p292
V Yeah, I'm here for the audition.  
p293
tp294
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p295
V Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise   tape or the infomercial?   
p296
tp297
a(V KRAMER 
p298
V Uh, let's see... well.   Cut to a montage of Kramer in group auditions for the productions the   receptionist mentioned.     Kramer and Chelsea, a woman he met in the horror movie audition, exit the   casting office.  
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V You scream good.  
p302
tp303
a(V CHELSEA 
p304
V You too.     Kramer and Chelsea are seated at a restaurant table.   
p305
tp306
a(V CHELSEA 
p307
V So, can I keep this treatment?  
p308
tp309
a(V KRAMER 
p310
V Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.  
p311
tp312
a(V CHELSEA 
p313
V 'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West   German television money.  
p314
tp315
a(V KRAMER 
p316
V Really.  
p317
tp318
a(V CHELSEA 
p319
V Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.    I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun,   only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.  
p320
tp321
a(V KRAMER 
p322
V Um-hm.  
p323
tp324
a(V CHELSEA 
p325
V What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a   bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean   it could just go on and on...  
p326
tp327
a(V KRAMER 
p328
V Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't   look! It's Fred Savage.  
p329
tp330
a(V CHELSEA 
p331
V Big deal.  
p332
tp333
a(V KRAMER 
p334
V He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime   opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a   copy of my treatment.  
p335
tp336
a(V CHELSEA 
p337
V Why are you breathing so hard?  
p338
tp339
a(V KRAMER 
p340
V Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me   luck, huh?   Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.   
p341
tp342
a(V KRAMER 
p343
V Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look   weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in   this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...     FRED SAVAGE  Thank you.  
p344
tp345
a(V KRAMER 
p346
V Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.    
p347
tp348
a(V FRED 
p349
V Thanks.  
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...   
p353
tp354
a(V FRED 
p355
V That's ok. Relax, relax.  
p356
tp357
a(V KRAMER 
p358
V Ok, but I got this...   Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the table collapses.   
p359
tp360
a(V KRAMER 
p361
V Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very   cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate   that you happened to be here at the same time as me.  
p362
tp363
a(V FRED 
p364
V Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.  
p365
tp366
a(V KRAMER 
p367
V I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.   
p368
tp369
a(V FRED 
p370
V Yeah.  
p371
tp372
a(V KRAMER 
p373
V So I'd like to give it to you.  
p374
tp375
a(V FRED 
p376
V Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!    
p377
tp378
a(V KRAMER 
p379
V Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.     Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves, Kramer gives   the rest of the patrons a thumbs-up.     George and Jerry are in their hotel room. Jerry's on the telephone.    
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would   you describe Kramer's hair?  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Curly.  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Wavy.  
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V What'd you ask me for?  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on    the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V Nope.  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just    the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?  
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V Hey, a shoe buffing machine!  
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?   
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body   lotion!  
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V About 6-3.  
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V Ooh, a shower cap!   KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK   
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Coming.   George walks to the door wearing a shower cap.  
p419
tp420
a(V LUPE 
p421
V Hello. I have more towels.  
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is   Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?    
p425
tp426
a(V LUPE 
p427
V Lupe.  
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making   up the bed in the morning?  
p431
tp432
a(V LUPE 
p433
V Yes.  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the   blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.  
p437
tp438
a(V LUPE 
p439
V Oh, yes, yes.  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and   swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in.   I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the   air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.  
p443
tp444
a(V LUPE 
p445
V Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.    
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?   
p449
tp450
a(V LUPE 
p451
V It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?   
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?   
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Excuse me, what?  
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V You want your blankets tucked in?  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V What blankets?  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE

p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.

p491
tp492
a(V JERRY

p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V You just said you weren't tucking.    
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where   Kramer is anyway.  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?   
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here   earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?  
p506
tp507
a(V LUPE 
p508
V Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.

p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V Bye-bye.   Lupe exits.  
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a    whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do   it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.  
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.   
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!   
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.   
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.   
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?     Cut to Jerry and George in the car, continuing their discussion.    
p548
tp549
a(V GEORGE 
p550
V You shouldn't have tucked.  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V I like it tucked.  
p554
tp555
a(V GEORGE 
p556
V Nobody tucks anymore.   As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives   off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office notices this   and picks up one of the photos.     Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head,   but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the   auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.    
p557
tp558
a(V OFFICER 
p559
V Hey, Lieutenant.   LT. MARTEL  Yeah.  
p560
tp561
a(V OFFICER 
p562
V This was found on her person.   LT. MARTEL  On her person? What kind of expression is that?   
p563
tp564
a(V OFFICER 
p565
V I don't know, sir. Police lingo.   LT. MARTEL  Oh yeah? What's your name, son.  
p566
tp567
a(V OFFICER 
p568
V Ross.   LT. MARTEL  Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?   
p569
tp570
a(V OFFICER 
p571
V Yes sir.   LT. MARTEL  She's dead. Have you got that?  
p572
tp573
a(V OFFICER 
p574
V Yes sir.   LT. MARTEL  Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit   patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.    
p575
tp576
a(V OFFICER 
p577
V Yes sir.   The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says "The Keys" A movie   treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first   name was is missing.   LT. MARTEL  I think we just caught a break.     Jerry and George are at the NBC studio.  
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on    the show?  
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V I don't know.  
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V Might meet a celebrity.  
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V I can't believe she threw out my napkin.    
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V What are you worried about, you know it.   
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V You gonna be alright here?  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander   around.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen   minutes.  
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V Go, go, go, don't worry about it.   Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near   George, obviously waiting for someone.  
p605
tp606
a(V GEORGE 
p607
V Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.     CORBIN BERNSEN  How ya doing?  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Big fan! Big fan.   CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah.  
p611
tp612
a(V GEORGE 
p613
V Hey, you grew a beard, huh?   CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.   
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.    CORBIN BERNSEN  Really.   Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'.  
p617
tp618
a(V GEORGE 
p619
V ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three   weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this   time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a   few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.   CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into   town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.     CORBIN BERNSEN  So you killed the cat.  
p623
tp624
a(V GEORGE 
p625
V That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of   natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new   cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not   gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I   go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show   me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new   cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here,   and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on   L.A. Law?   Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.   Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.   
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.    GEORGE WENDT  Oh, of course not.  
p629
tp630
a(V GEORGE 
p631
V But really, it's enough with the bar already.    GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, well.  
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?    GEORGE WENDT  Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.  
p635
tp636
a(V GEORGE 
p637
V Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?    GEORGE WENDT  Well yeah, they do, heh heh.  
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.    GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, you oughta write one of those.  
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Yeah?   GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...   
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE 
p646
V Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!    Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily.  
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V How's it going?  
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent   conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V Really?  
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V Yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was   incredibly articulate!  
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V You got toilet paper on your heel there.     George looks down, Jerry walks away.     The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.  
p662
tp663
a(V ANNOUNCER 
p664
V It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin   Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.   Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.   CORBIN BERNSEN  Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give   me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside   in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to   watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed   the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a   new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to   represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law.   Thanks a lot.   Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.     Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.    
p665
tp666
a(V HELENA 
p667
V He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange.   I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about   that, I have many suitors.   Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview.   GEORGE WENDT  It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get   people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I   ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about,   you know, not doing the show in a bar.   Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing besides George.    Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van Kramer hitched a   ride to LA in (see "The Keys") known only as 'The Freak' is being questioned by   the Lt.   THE FREAK  So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man   before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been   soaking in Ivory liquid?   Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt are talking   between takes.   GEORGE WENDT  The guy you talked to, what did he look like?    CORBIN BERNSEN  Short little bald guy with glasses.     GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.    CORBIN BERNSEN  It never ends, does it?   Cut to Jerry, on stage, doing his routine.  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little    uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.   Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.   Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.   Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone.   LT. MARTEL  Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh,   Kramer.     George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set,  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V I was terrible.  
p674
tp675
a(V GEORGE 
p676
V What are you, crazy? You were fine.    
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to   say, that whole thing about the, uh...  
p680
tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V Conveyor belt.  
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.    
p686
tp687
a(V GEORGE 
p688
V I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
