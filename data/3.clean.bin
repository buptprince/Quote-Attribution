aVmale unbonding written by larry david & jerry seinfeld most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. this is what men enjoy doing. have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. they just come wandering out of the house like zombies. men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. just you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, honey, i think jim's working on something over there. so they run over to the guy. now they don't actually help the guy. no, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. that's what men want to do. we want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. you know, what are you using, the philips head? you know, we feel involved. that's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. they cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. but if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. right over there. what are you using the steel girders down there? yeah, that'll hold.

p99
aa(lp100
Vjerry
p101
aVhis name is joel horneck. he lived like three houses down from me when i grew up. he had a ping pong table. we were friends. should i suffer the rest of my life because i like to play ping pong? i was ten. i would've been friends with stalin if he had a ping pong table he's so self-involved.
p102
aa(lp103
Vkramer
p104
aVthat's for me. kramerica industries oh, hi, mark no, no, no. forget that. i got a better idea. a pizza place where you make your own pie.

p111
aa(lp112
Vgeorge
p113
aVi don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, i'll tell you that.
p114
aa(lp115
Vjerry
p116
aVi don't bother with him. he's been calling me for seven years. i've never called him once! he's got the attention span of a five-year-old. sometimes i sit there and i make up things just to see if he's paying attention.
p117
aa(lp118
Vgeorge
p119
aVi don't understand why you spend time with this guy.
p120
aa(lp121
Vjerry
p122
aVwhat can i do? break up with him? tell him i don't think we're right for each other he's a guy. at least with a woman, there's a precendent. you know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
p123
aa(lp124
Vgeorge
p125
aVno, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
p126
aa(lp127
Vjerry
p128
aVjust break up with him?
p129
aa(lp130
Vgeorge
p131
aVabsolutely. you just tell him the truth.
p132
aa(lp133
Vjerry
p134
aVas a guy i don't know how i can break up with another guy. you know what i mean? i don't know how to say, bill, i feel i need to see other men. do you know what i mean? there's nothing i can do. i have to wait for someone to die. i think that's the only way out of this relationship. it could be a long time. see, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. that's almost all we need to have in common. 'cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. if there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is so, what's in the refrigerator?
p135
