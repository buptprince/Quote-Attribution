aVthe robbery written by matt goldman so i move into the centre lane, now i get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason i guess, that she thought that i cut her off. so, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. it seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. it's a finger, what does it mean? someone shows me one of their fingers and i'm supposed to feel bad. is that the way it's supposed to work?
p3
aa(lp4
Vi
p5
aVmean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't you? i would feel worse if i got the toe, than if i got the finger. 'cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and uh look at that toe, buddy. i mean, that's really insulting to get the toe, isn't it ?
p6
aa(lp7
Vjerry

aVcall the police. you really should call the police. so yeah, i'm calling the police. stakeouts, manhunts i'm gonna see some real action. right, you think that. so, the police give you your copy. now unless they give the crook his copy, i don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do you? it's not like batman, where there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. it makes them a lot tougher to spot. did you lose a sony? it could be the penguin i think we can round him up, he's dressed like a penguin! we can find him, he's a penguin!
