V  THE STOCK TIP  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because     money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a    restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. "More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives." Then after the meal, you know,    you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset,    you know. They're mystified by the check. "What is this? How could this be?" They start passing it around the table, "Does this look right to you? We're not hungry    now. Why are we buying all this food?!"    I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

tp3
a(V GEORGE 
p4
V I never heard him say anything really funny.   
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor.   
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all     the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?   
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V I don't know but he ain't funny.   (Elaine joins them, they check their watches.)  
p17
tp18
a(V ELAINE 
p19
V I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.    
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V No problem.  
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V I dropped a grape.  
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Pardon?  
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I    have no idea where it went.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it.   
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with  -   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Robert.  
p41
tp42
a(V ELAINE 
p43
V Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you    know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away fro the    weekend because of these cats.  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V Guys with cats.. I don't know.  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing -   
p50
tp51
a(V ELAINE 
p52
V Vanessa.  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.   
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two    hours. That's a dating decathlon.  
p59
tp60
a(V ELAINE 
p61
V (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with    the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it.  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?     (Elaine gets the paper, he starts flipping through it.)  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. (Elaine laughs) There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas    panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.   
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting it.   
p71
tp72
a(V ELAINE 
p73
V You're getting what?  
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V A stock.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V What stock?  
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?    
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V Maybe.  
p86
tp87
a(V GOERGE 
p88
V He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed to be a big merger.    He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.   
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V How high's it suppose to go?  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Boy.. I don't know.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V I'd do it but I don't have any money.    
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V What kind of company is it?  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.    
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V Televising opera?  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V Some sort of electronic thingy.  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Well, how much are you going to invest?    
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V (Unsure) Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.   
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Boy..  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. It's gone up three points since I've been watching it.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V What if I lose it?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together.   
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V (gives in) All right -- twenty-five hundred.   
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V That's it.   (Waitress arrives)  
p137
tp138
a(V WAITRESS 
p139
V Yeah, can I take your order?  
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.    
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.   
p146
tp147
a(V ELAINE 
p148
V Tuna?  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Oh, the dolphin thing?  
p152
tp153
a(V ELAINE 
p154
V They're dying in the nets.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.   
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?   
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. "Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead." ..Alright.. alright. I'll have    a chicken salad.  
p164
tp165
a(V ELAINE 
p166
V And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.   
p167
tp168
a(V WAITRESS 
p169
V Okay. (To George) What about you?  
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V I'll have the tuna.   (Scene ends.)   (A Korean Market)  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.   
p176
tp177
a(V VANESSA 
p178
V Why didn't you do something?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the    mouth.. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?    STOCK BOY  No puffs. Just flakes.  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Have you thought any more about that trip?   
p185
tp186
a(V VANESSA 
p187
V Yeah, I've been thinking about it.    
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.   
p191
tp192
a(V VANESSA 
p193
V I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's a lot of pressure.    
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish     (snaps) three days.  
p197
tp198
a(V VANESSA 
p199
V Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?   
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.   
p203
tp204
a(V VANESSA 
p205
V (Starting to like the idea) Really? Could we go fishing up there?   
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?   
p209
tp210
a(V VANESSA 
p211
V They have marlin in Vermont?  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Oh, big fighting marlin.   (Jerry picks up a paper)  
p215
tp216
a(V VANESSA 
p217
V Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.   
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment. Jerry's looking at a road map; Kramer is looking at the paper)   
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Is that my paper?  
p224
tp225
a(V KRAMER 
p226
V Bad news, my friend.  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V What? What news?  
p230
tp231
a(V KRAMER 
p232
V Sendrax.  
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!  
p236
tp237
a(V KRAMER 
p238
V Two and a half points.  
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper) That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!   
p242
tp243
a(V KRAMER 
p244
V Hey, I told ya.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V (Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.  
p248
tp249
a(V KRAMER 
p250
V It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.   
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V (Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza, please.   
p254
tp255
a(V KRAMER 
p256
V Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!   
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V (Into phone) George, what's going on?!    
p260
tp261
a(V KRAMER 
p262
V Sell it, just say I'm selling!  
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He    hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days!  
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.    
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?   
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up.    
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V Okay.  
p278
tp279
a(V KRAMER 
p280
V You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.   
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V You're gone alright.  
p284
tp285
a(V KRAMER 
p286
V (Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map.. what..   
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.   
p290
tp291
a(V KRAMER 
p292
V Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.    
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V What friends?  
p296
tp297
a(V KRAMER 
p298
V Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.    (Phone rings)  
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look) 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists.    They're.. they're.. they're.. huge.   (Jerry answers phone)  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy    who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.    (Kramer has a pleased reaction on his face)   (Scene ends)   (Dry-Cleaning store; Jerry and George are in line)  
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V So you don't know what's wrong with him?   
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.   
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.   
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Well, this is it. I'm selling.  
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V Just give it a little more time.  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I"m not cut out for investing.   
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.   
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Where?  
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V To the hospital.  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V The hospital?  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?   
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.   
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.   
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (knocking on glass) "How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (makes hissing sound) By the    way, what's happening with Sendrax?"  
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V Maybe he's resting.  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V Who goes to the hospital to rest?  
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V What are you, a doctor?  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?   
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Alright.   (Jerry moves up in line, a woman takes his place. George didn't notice)   
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V (To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.    (Woman gives him a look)   DRY CLEANER  May I help you?  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.    DRY CLEANER  When did you bring it in?  
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!    DRY CLEANER  You got a receipt?  
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V I can't find the receipt.   DRY CLEANER  You should get the receipt.  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!    DRY CLEANER  Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?    
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! In fact, forget the money. I don't even    want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt.    DRY CLEANER  Maybe you asked for it to be washed?    
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V No.. dry-cleaned.   DRY CLEANER  Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing..   
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!    DRY CLEANER  I shrunk it.   (Scene ends.)   (Night club)  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, "It's not    our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation." You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this    is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids    that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (brushes    shirt) - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going (with imaginary brush) "Come on, hurry up! There's a    lot of shirts today."   (Jerry's apartment)   (Elaine sneezes)  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Bless you.  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers    four times a day and he can't count to ten. So don't give me hygiene.   
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V So what are you gonna do?  
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to    rub out a couple of cats?  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?   
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?   
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V I'm no cat killer.  
p416
tp417
a(V ELAINE 
p418
V How about we go over there right now and we shave them?   
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.   
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V He actually wen to the hospital?  
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Yeah.  
p428
tp429
a(V ELAINE 
p430
V Oh man, he's nuts.  
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper) I know, I know. It's down again.    
p434
tp435
a(V KRAMER 
p436
V How much are you down altogether?  
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.    
p440
tp441
a(V KRAMER 
p442
V Wow.  
p443
tp444

V You don't have to say "Wow." I know it's "Wow." And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?    (Intercom buzzes)

a(V JERRY 
p448
V It's George. (Presses button to let George in.)    (Elaine goes into the bathroom; kramer picks up some binoculars and looks ou the window)

a(V KRAMER 
p451
V Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.    
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V I really don't need to look.  
p455
tp456
a(V KRAMER 
p457
V What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.    
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.    
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)    (Enter George; he flops onto the couch)  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head "no".) How long were you there?   
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V Fifteen seconds.  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V You told him you knew Simons?  
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475
V Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know     what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.   (Elaine exits bathroom)  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.   
p479
tp480
a(V ELAINE 
p481
V Didn't work, huh?  
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V (Laughs) Not quite.  
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?   
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.    (Scene ends.)   (Country Inn)  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now.

V I know. You mentioned it.  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V Oh yeah, right. (To himself) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got    nothing left to say. Wait.. wait.. got one. (To Vanessa) That's a nice watch. Do you wind it?   
p500
tp501
a(V VANESSA 
p502
V No, it's got a little battery.  
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V Well, that's good. (To himself) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. (To Vanessa)    That' the manager? Do you wnat me to see if we can get another room?   
p506
tp507
a(V VANESSA 
p508
V No, it's okay.  
p509
tp510
a(V JERRY 
p511
V So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold - charming?    
p512
tp513
a(V VANESSA 
p514
V Not especially.  
p515
tp516
a(V JERRY 
p517
V Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?    
p518
tp519
a(V VANESSA 
p520
V What can we do? It's raining.  
p521
tp522
a(V JERRY 
p523
V We cold play "Sorry!" We cold play "Steal the Old Man's Bundle." (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What    kind of perfume is that you're wearing?  
p524
tp525
a(V VANESSA 
p526
V Oh, you've never heard of it.  
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V No, what? What kind is it?  
p530
tp531
a(V VANESSA 
p532
V I can't tell you.  
p533
tp534
a(V JERRY 
p535
V (To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby) Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?   
p536
tp537
a(V VANESSA 
p538
V That stock? I thought you got out of that?   
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!    
p542
tp543
a(V VANESSA 
p544
V I told you not to sell.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V You did not tell me not to sell.  
p548
tp549
a(V VANESSA 
p550
V I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?    
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!   
p554
tp555
a(V VANESSA 
p556
V That's probably why.. (stops herself)    
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V What?  
p560
tp561
a(V VANESSA 
p562
V Forget it.  
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V No, what? 'That's probably why..'  
p566
tp567
a(V VANESSA 
p568
V That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.    
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V (To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that purfume..    (Scene ends.)   (Coffee shop)  
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?   
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V I'm good, thanks.  
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.   
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V I'm kinda full.  
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V So don't finish it.  
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V (acidly) She's full. (George puts up his hands in an "excuse me" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little trasaction     there? All told?  
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V I don't like to discuss figures.  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V How much?  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.   
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?   
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.    (Elaine sneezes)  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Is taht still from the cats?  
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V No, I just have a cold.  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V So, what ever happened with that?  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs)  
p617
tp618
a(V GEORGE 
p619
V He chose the cats?  
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V They're very clean animals.  
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.   
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.    
p629
tp630
a(V GEORGE 
p631
V I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time.    You'd get all the money back - you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont.   
p632
tp633
a(V ELAINE 
p634
V Superman can go back in time?  
p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V We went over that.  
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of robot butcher.   
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V A robot butcher?  
p644
tp645
a(V GOERGE 
p646
V Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. (Calling to waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress tears of check, George stops her) No, no, no. That'     ought to coever it. (He hands her some money, she turns to leave, George stops her) Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. (looks at the check, then take some money out    of her hand.) (Urging Jerry and Elaine to eat) Come on, come on, come on..    (Scene ends.)   (Night club)
