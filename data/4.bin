aV  THE STOCK TIP  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because     money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a    restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. "More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives." Then after the meal, you know,    you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset,    you know. They're mystified by the check. "What is this? How could this be?" They start passing it around the table, "Does this look right to you? We're not hungry    now. Why are we buying all this food?!"    I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

V GEORGE 
p5
aV I never heard him say anything really funny.   
p6
aa(lp7
V JERRY 
p8
aV But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor.   
p9
aa(lp10
V GEORGE 
p11
aV You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all     the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.  
p12
aa(lp13
V JERRY 
p14
aV Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?   
p15
aa(lp16
V GEORGE 
p17
aV I don't know but he ain't funny.   (Elaine joins them, they check their watches.)  
p18
aa(lp19
V ELAINE 
p20
aV I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.    
p21
aa(lp22
V JERRY 
p23
aV No problem.  
p24
aa(lp25
V ELAINE 
p26
aV I dropped a grape.  
p27
aa(lp28
V GEORGE 
p29
aV Pardon?  
p30
aa(lp31
V ELAINE 
p32
aV I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I    have no idea where it went.  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it.   
p36
aa(lp37
V ELAINE 
p38
aV No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with  -   
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV Robert.  
p42
aa(lp43
V ELAINE 
p44
aV Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you    know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away fro the    weekend because of these cats.  
p45
aa(lp46
V GEORGE 
p47
aV Guys with cats.. I don't know.  
p48
aa(lp49
V JERRY 
p50
aV I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing -   
p51
aa(lp52
V ELAINE 
p53
aV Vanessa.  
p54
aa(lp55
V JERRY 
p56
aV Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.   
p57
aa(lp58
V GEORGE 
p59
aV Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two    hours. That's a dating decathlon.  
p60
aa(lp61
V ELAINE 
p62
aV (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with    the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it.  
p63
aa(lp64
V GEORGE 
p65
aV (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?     (Elaine gets the paper, he starts flipping through it.)  
p66
aa(lp67
V JERRY 
p68
aV You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. (Elaine laughs) There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas    panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.   
p69
aa(lp70
V GEORGE 
p71
aV (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting it.   
p72
aa(lp73
V ELAINE 
p74
aV You're getting what?  
p75
aa(lp76
V GEORGE 
p77
aV A stock.  
p78
aa(lp79
V JERRY 
p80
aV What stock?  
p81
aa(lp82
V GEORGE 
p83
aV Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?    
p84
aa(lp85
V JERRY 
p86
aV Maybe.  
p87
aa(lp88
V GOERGE 
p89
aV He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed to be a big merger.    He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.   
p90
aa(lp91
V JERRY 
p92
aV How high's it suppose to go?  
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?   
p96
aa(lp97
V JERRY 
p98
aV Boy.. I don't know.  
p99
aa(lp100
V ELAINE 
p101
aV I'd do it but I don't have any money.    
p102
aa(lp103
V JERRY 
p104
aV What kind of company is it?  
p105
aa(lp106
V GEORGE 
p107
aV It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.    
p108
aa(lp109
V ELAINE 
p110
aV Televising opera?  
p111
aa(lp112
V GEORGE 
p113
aV Some sort of electronic thingy.  
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV Well, how much are you going to invest?    
p117
aa(lp118
V GEORGE 
p119
aV (Unsure) Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.   
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV Boy..  
p123
aa(lp124
V GEORGE 
p125
aV C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. It's gone up three points since I've been watching it.   
p126
aa(lp127
V JERRY 
p128
aV What if I lose it?  
p129
aa(lp130
V GEORGE 
p131
aV C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together.   
p132
aa(lp133
V JERRY 
p134
aV (gives in) All right -- twenty-five hundred.   
p135
aa(lp136
V GEORGE 
p137
aV That's it.   (Waitress arrives)  
p138
aa(lp139
V WAITRESS 
p140
aV Yeah, can I take your order?  
p141
aa(lp142
V GEORGE 
p143
aV (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.    
p144
aa(lp145
V JERRY 
p146
aV My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.   
p147
aa(lp148
V ELAINE 
p149
aV Tuna?  
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV Oh, the dolphin thing?  
p153
aa(lp154
V ELAINE 
p155
aV They're dying in the nets.  
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.   
p159
aa(lp160
V ELAINE 
p161
aV Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?   
p162
aa(lp163
V JERRY 
p164
aV Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. "Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead." ..Alright.. alright. I'll have    a chicken salad.  
p165
aa(lp166
V ELAINE 
p167
aV And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.   
p168
aa(lp169
V WAITRESS 
p170
aV Okay. (To George) What about you?  
p171
aa(lp172
V GEORGE 
p173
aV I'll have the tuna.   (Scene ends.)   (A Korean Market)  
p174
aa(lp175
V JERRY 
p176
aV I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.   
p177
aa(lp178
V VANESSA 
p179
aV Why didn't you do something?  
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the    mouth.. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?    STOCK BOY  No puffs. Just flakes.  
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV Have you thought any more about that trip?   
p186
aa(lp187
V VANESSA 
p188
aV Yeah, I've been thinking about it.    
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.   
p192
aa(lp193
V VANESSA 
p194
aV I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's a lot of pressure.    
p195
aa(lp196
V JERRY 
p197
aV It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish     (snaps) three days.  
p198
aa(lp199
V VANESSA 
p200
aV Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?   
p201
aa(lp202
V JERRY 
p203
aV Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.   
p204
aa(lp205
V VANESSA 
p206
aV (Starting to like the idea) Really? Could we go fishing up there?   
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?   
p210
aa(lp211
V VANESSA 
p212
aV They have marlin in Vermont?  
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV Oh, big fighting marlin.   (Jerry picks up a paper)  
p216
aa(lp217
V VANESSA 
p218
aV Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.   
p219
aa(lp220
V JERRY 
p221
aV I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment. Jerry's looking at a road map; Kramer is looking at the paper)   
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV Is that my paper?  
p225
aa(lp226
V KRAMER 
p227
aV Bad news, my friend.  
p228
aa(lp229
V JERRY 
p230
aV What? What news?  
p231
aa(lp232
V KRAMER 
p233
aV Sendrax.  
p234
aa(lp235
V JERRY 
p236
aV Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!  
p237
aa(lp238
V KRAMER 
p239
aV Two and a half points.  
p240
aa(lp241
V JERRY 
p242
aV Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper) That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!   
p243
aa(lp244
V KRAMER 
p245
aV Hey, I told ya.  
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV (Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.  
p249
aa(lp250
V KRAMER 
p251
aV It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.   
p252
aa(lp253
V JERRY 
p254
aV (Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza, please.   
p255
aa(lp256
V KRAMER 
p257
aV Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!   
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV (Into phone) George, what's going on?!    
p261
aa(lp262
V KRAMER 
p263
aV Sell it, just say I'm selling!  
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY 
p266
aV (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He    hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days!  
p267
aa(lp268
V KRAMER 
p269
aV You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.    
p270
aa(lp271
V JERRY 
p272
aV Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?   
p273
aa(lp274
V KRAMER 
p275
aV Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up.    
p276
aa(lp277
V JERRY 
p278
aV Okay.  
p279
aa(lp280
V KRAMER 
p281
aV You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.   
p282
aa(lp283
V JERRY 
p284
aV You're gone alright.  
p285
aa(lp286
V KRAMER 
p287
aV (Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map.. what..   
p288
aa(lp289
V JERRY 
p290
aV Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.   
p291
aa(lp292
V KRAMER 
p293
aV Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.    
p294
aa(lp295
V JERRY 
p296
aV What friends?  
p297
aa(lp298
V KRAMER 
p299
aV Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.    (Phone rings)  
p300
aa(lp301
V KRAMER 
p302
aV Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look) 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists.    They're.. they're.. they're.. huge.   (Jerry answers phone)  
p303
aa(lp304
V JERRY 
p305
aV George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy    who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.    (Kramer has a pleased reaction on his face)   (Scene ends)   (Dry-Cleaning store; Jerry and George are in line)  
p306
aa(lp307
V JERRY 
p308
aV So you don't know what's wrong with him?   
p309
aa(lp310
V GEORGE 
p311
aV All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.   
p312
aa(lp313
V JERRY 
p314
aV Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?   
p315
aa(lp316
V GEORGE 
p317
aV Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.   
p318
aa(lp319
V JERRY 
p320
aV Well, this is it. I'm selling.  
p321
aa(lp322
V GEORGE 
p323
aV Just give it a little more time.  
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I"m not cut out for investing.   
p327
aa(lp328
V GEORGE 
p329
aV Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.   
p330
aa(lp331
V JERRY 
p332
aV Where?  
p333
aa(lp334
V GEORGE 
p335
aV To the hospital.  
p336
aa(lp337
V JERRY 
p338
aV The hospital?  
p339
aa(lp340
V GEORGE 
p341
aV I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?   
p342
aa(lp343
V JERRY 
p344
aV Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.   
p345
aa(lp346
V GEORGE 
p347
aV So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.   
p348
aa(lp349
V JERRY 
p350
aV What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (knocking on glass) "How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (makes hissing sound) By the    way, what's happening with Sendrax?"  
p351
aa(lp352
V GEORGE 
p353
aV Maybe he's resting.  
p354
aa(lp355
V JERRY 
p356
aV Who goes to the hospital to rest?  
p357
aa(lp358
V GEORGE 
p359
aV What are you, a doctor?  
p360
aa(lp361
V JERRY 
p362
aV Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?   
p363
aa(lp364
V GEORGE 
p365
aV Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.   
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY 
p368
aV Alright.   (Jerry moves up in line, a woman takes his place. George didn't notice)   
p369
aa(lp370
V GEORGE 
p371
aV (To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.    (Woman gives him a look)   DRY CLEANER  May I help you?  
p372
aa(lp373
V JERRY 
p374
aV Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.    DRY CLEANER  When did you bring it in?  
p375
aa(lp376
V JERRY 
p377
aV What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!    DRY CLEANER  You got a receipt?  
p378
aa(lp379
V JERRY 
p380
aV I can't find the receipt.   DRY CLEANER  You should get the receipt.  
p381
aa(lp382
V JERRY 
p383
aV Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!    DRY CLEANER  Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?    
p384
aa(lp385
V JERRY 
p386
aV What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! In fact, forget the money. I don't even    want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt.    DRY CLEANER  Maybe you asked for it to be washed?    
p387
aa(lp388
V JERRY 
p389
aV No.. dry-cleaned.   DRY CLEANER  Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing..   
p390
aa(lp391
V JERRY 
p392
aV (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!    DRY CLEANER  I shrunk it.   (Scene ends.)   (Night club)  
p393
aa(lp394
V JERRY 
p395
aV I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, "It's not    our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation." You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this    is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids    that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (brushes    shirt) - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going (with imaginary brush) "Come on, hurry up! There's a    lot of shirts today."   (Jerry's apartment)   (Elaine sneezes)  
p396
aa(lp397
V JERRY 
p398
aV Bless you.  
p399
aa(lp400
V ELAINE 
p401
aV Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers    four times a day and he can't count to ten. So don't give me hygiene.   
p402
aa(lp403
V JERRY 
p404
aV So what are you gonna do?  
p405
aa(lp406
V ELAINE 
p407
aV I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to    rub out a couple of cats?  
p408
aa(lp409
V JERRY 
p410
aV Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?   
p411
aa(lp412
V ELAINE 
p413
aV What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?   
p414
aa(lp415
V JERRY 
p416
aV I'm no cat killer.  
p417
aa(lp418
V ELAINE 
p419
aV How about we go over there right now and we shave them?   
p420
aa(lp421
V JERRY 
p422
aV I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.   
p423
aa(lp424
V ELAINE 
p425
aV He actually wen to the hospital?  
p426
aa(lp427
V JERRY 
p428
aV Yeah.  
p429
aa(lp430
V ELAINE 
p431
aV Oh man, he's nuts.  
p432
aa(lp433
V JERRY

p443
aV Wow.  
p444
aa(lp445
V JERRY 
p446
aV You don't have to say "Wow." I know it's "Wow." And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?    (Intercom buzzes)  
p447
aa(lp448
V JERRY 
p449
aV It's George. (Presses button to let George in.)    (Elaine goes into the bathroom; kramer picks up some binoculars and looks ou the window)   
p450
aa(lp451
V KRAMER 
p452
aV Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.    
p453
aa(lp454
V JERRY 
p455
aV I really don't need to look.  
p456
aa(lp457
V KRAMER 
p458
aV What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.    
p459
aa(lp460
V JERRY 
p461
aV Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.    
p462
aa(lp463
V KRAMER 
p464
aV I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)    (Enter George; he flops onto the couch)  
p465
aa(lp466
V JERRY 
p467
aV What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head "no".) How long were you there?   
p468
aa(lp469
V GEORGE 
p470
aV Fifteen seconds.  
p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV You told him you knew Simons?  
p474
aa(lp475
V GEORGE 
p476
aV Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know     what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.   (Elaine exits bathroom)  
p477
aa(lp478
V JERRY 
p479
aV Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.   
p480
aa(lp481
V ELAINE 
p482
aV Didn't work, huh?  
p483
aa(lp484
V GEORGE 
p485
aV (Laughs) Not quite.  
p486
aa(lp487
V ELAINE 
p488
aV Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?   
p489
aa(lp490
V GEORGE 
p491
aV I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.    (Scene ends.)   (Country Inn)  
p492
aa(lp493
V JERRY 
p494
aV So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now.   
p495
aa(lp496
V VANESSA

aV I know. You mentioned it.  
p498
aa(lp499
V JERRY 
p500
aV Oh yeah, right. (To himself) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got    nothing left to say. Wait.. wait.. got one. (To Vanessa) That's a nice watch. Do you wind it?   
p501
aa(lp502
V VANESSA 
p503
aV No, it's got a little battery.  
p504
aa(lp505
V JERRY 
p506
aV Well, that's good. (To himself) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. (To Vanessa)    That' the manager? Do you wnat me to see if we can get another room?   
p507
aa(lp508
V VANESSA 
p509
aV No, it's okay.  
p510
aa(lp511
V JERRY 
p512
aV So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold - charming?    
p513
aa(lp514
V VANESSA 
p515
aV Not especially.  
p516
aa(lp517
V JERRY 
p518
aV Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?    
p519
aa(lp520
V VANESSA 
p521
aV What can we do? It's raining.  
p522
aa(lp523
V JERRY 
p524
aV We cold play "Sorry!" We cold play "Steal the Old Man's Bundle." (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What    kind of perfume is that you're wearing?  
p525
aa(lp526
V VANESSA 
p527
aV Oh, you've never heard of it.  
p528
aa(lp529
V JERRY 
p530
aV No, what? What kind is it?  
p531
aa(lp532
V VANESSA 
p533
aV I can't tell you.  
p534
aa(lp535
V JERRY 
p536
aV (To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby) Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?   
p537
aa(lp538
V VANESSA 
p539
aV That stock? I thought you got out of that?   
p540
aa(lp541
V JERRY 
p542
aV I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!    
p543
aa(lp544
V VANESSA 
p545
aV I told you not to sell.  
p546
aa(lp547
V JERRY 
p548
aV You did not tell me not to sell.  
p549
aa(lp550
V VANESSA 
p551
aV I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?    
p552
aa(lp553
V JERRY 
p554
aV Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!   
p555
aa(lp556
V VANESSA 
p557
aV That's probably why.. (stops herself)    
p558
aa(lp559
V JERRY 
p560
aV What?  
p561
aa(lp562
V VANESSA 
p563
aV Forget it.  
p564
aa(lp565
V JERRY 
p566
aV No, what? 'That's probably why..'  
p567
aa(lp568
V VANESSA 
p569
aV That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.    
p570
aa(lp571
V JERRY 
p572
aV (To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that purfume..    (Scene ends.)   (Coffee shop)  
p573
aa(lp574
V GEORGE 
p575
aV Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?   
p576
aa(lp577
V JERRY 
p578
aV I'm good, thanks.  
p579
aa(lp580
V GEORGE 
p581
aV Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.   
p582
aa(lp583
V ELAINE 
p584
aV I'm kinda full.  
p585
aa(lp586
V GEORGE 
p587
aV So don't finish it.  
p588
aa(lp589
V JERRY 
p590
aV (acidly) She's full. (George puts up his hands in an "excuse me" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little trasaction     there? All told?  
p591
aa(lp592
V GEORGE 
p593
aV I don't like to discuss figures.  
p594
aa(lp595
V JERRY 
p596
aV How much?  
p597
aa(lp598
V GEORGE 
p599
aV I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.   
p600
aa(lp601
V JERRY 
p602
aV So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?   
p603
aa(lp604
V GEORGE 
p605
aV No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.    (Elaine sneezes)  
p606
aa(lp607
V JERRY 
p608
aV Is taht still from the cats?  
p609
aa(lp610
V ELAINE 
p611
aV No, I just have a cold.  
p612
aa(lp613
V JERRY 
p614
aV So, what ever happened with that?  
p615
aa(lp616
V ELAINE 
p617
aV I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs)  
p618
aa(lp619
V GEORGE 
p620
aV He chose the cats?  
p621
aa(lp622
V ELAINE 
p623
aV They're very clean animals.  
p624
aa(lp625
V JERRY 
p626
aV I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.   
p627
aa(lp628
V ELAINE 
p629
aV Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.    
p630
aa(lp631
V GEORGE 
p632
aV I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time.    You'd get all the money back - you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont.   
p633
aa(lp634
V ELAINE 
p635
aV Superman can go back in time?  
p636
aa(lp637
V JERRY 
p638
aV We went over that.  
p639
aa(lp640
V GEORGE 
p641
aV Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of robot butcher.   
p642
aa(lp643
V JERRY 
p644
aV A robot butcher?  
p645
aa(lp646
V GOERGE 
p647
aV Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. (Calling to waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress tears of check, George stops her) No, no, no. That'     ought to coever it. (He hands her some money, she turns to leave, George stops her) Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. (looks at the check, then take some money out    of her hand.) (Urging Jerry and Elaine to eat) Come on, come on, come on..    (Scene ends.)   (Night club)
