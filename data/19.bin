V  THE PEN  Written by Larry David     (Night club)   I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."         (Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents)

V We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.   
p32
tp33
a(V HELEN

p37
V What's the difference?  
p38
tp39

p62
tp63
a(V HELEN 
p64
V How much is a rent-a-car?  
p65
tp66

p68
tp69
a(V HELEN

V What? You're crazy.  
p71
tp72

V Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

tp78
a(V MORTY

p91
V God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?   
p92
tp93
a(V HELEN 
p94
V You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?    
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?   
p98
tp99
a(V HELEN 
p100
V Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.   
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY

p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE

p115
V Are you kidding? They built the lake.    
p116
tp117
a(V HELEN 
p118
V But it's real. It's water.   (Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room)

p122
tp123

p124
V I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.

V (to Morty) What about you?  
p149

V Why should I be comfortable?  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V (to Helen) What about him?  
p155
tp156
a(V HELEN 
p157
V Don't worry, he's comfortable.  
p158
tp159

a(V ELAINE

V Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)   
p167
tp168
a(V HELEN 
p169
V (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.    
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V No that's not such a good idea.  
p173
tp174
a(V HELEN 
p175
V Well I tought that...  
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V Not now. She's right inside.  
p179
tp180
a(V HELEN 
p181
V (quieter) What happened?  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.   
p185
tp186
a(V HELEN 
p187
V What does that mean?  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V Well...  
p191
tp192
a(V MORTY 
p193
V (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?   
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Shh! Nothing, nothing.  
p197
tp198
a(V HELEN 
p199
V Elaine...  
p200
tp201
a(V MORTY 
p202
V (still loud) What about her?  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.    
p206
tp207
a(V MORTY 
p208
V (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.    
p209
tp210
a(V HELEN 
p211
V He's an idealist.  
p212
tp213
a(V MORTY 
p214
V What the hell are you looking for?    
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.   
p218
tp219
a(V HELEN 
p220
V He likes looking.  
p221
tp222
a(V MORTY 
p223
V So look.  
p224
tp225
a(V HELEN 
p226
V But how long can you look?  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V I'm going for the record.   (Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)    
p230
tp231
a(V HELEN 
p232
V You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.   
p233
tp234

p293

p326
tp327
a(V JACK 
p328
V See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.     (Jerry notices Klompus's pen)  
p329
tp330

p331
V What kind of pen is that?  
p332
tp333
a(V JACK 
p334

tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Yeah.  
p338
tp339
a(V JACK 
p340

p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?    
p344
tp345
a(V JACK 
p346
V Oh it was a gift.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY

a(V JACK 
p397
V Stop it!  
p398
tp399
a(V DORIS

a(V JERRY 
p406
V Thanks again.  
p407
tp408
a(V JACK 
p409
V Come on!  
p410
tp411
a(V DORIS 
p412
V (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)    
p413
tp414
a(V HELEN 
p415
V (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?   
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V What he gave it to me.  
p419
tp420
a(V HELEN 
p421
V You didn't have to take it.  
p422
tp423
a(V MORTY 
p424
V Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.   
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V He offered it to me.  
p428
tp429
a(V HELEN 
p430
V Because you made such a big fuss about it.   
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?   
p434
tp435
a(V HELEN 
p436
V You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)   
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.    
p440
tp441
a(V HELEN 
p442
V He loves that pen.  
p443
tp444
a(V MORTY 
p445
V Oh come on!  
p446
tp447
a(V HELEN 
p448
V He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.   
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.   
p452
tp453
a(V HELEN 
p454
V He didn't think you'd accpet.  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Well, he was wrong.  
p458
tp459
a(V HELEN 
p460
V I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at their argument)   
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V So you want me to return it?  
p464
tp465
a(V HELEN 
p466
V Yes.  
p467
tp468
a(V MORTY 
p469
V He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.   
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Hey I don't even want the pen now!    
p473
tp474
a(V MORTY 
p475
V Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!   
p476
tp477
a(V ELAINE 
p478
V Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside down.    (scene ends)       (condo's guest room)   (Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)    (knock on door)  
p479

a(V ELAINE 
p481
V Come in.  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Are you O.K. in here?  
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?   
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.   
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.    
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.    
p497
tp498
a(V ELAINE 
p499
V I am never gonna fall asleep.  
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.    
p503
tp504
a(V ELAINE 
p505
V How can they not put the air conditioning on?   
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V They're nuts with temperature.  
p509
tp510
a(V ELAINE 
p511
V This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.   
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V How about that guy writing a check for  19.45?   
p515
tp516
a(V ELAINE 
p517
V I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.    
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)     (scene ends)       (condo, morning)   (Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)    
p521
tp522
a(V MORTY 
p523
V Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?   
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Stay on Biscayne.  
p527
tp528
a(V HELEN 
p529
V You're going underwater?  
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.   
p533
tp534
a(V HELEN 
p535
V What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?    
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY

V What happened?  
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE

V That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.   
p554
tp555
a(V HELEN 
p556
V (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.   
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V Then YOU would be hunched over.  
p560
tp561

p563
tp564

tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V You can go.  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.   
p575
tp576
a(V HELEN 
p577
V Don't go.  
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V You sure?  
p581
tp582
a(V MORTY

tp585
a(V JERRY

a(V JERRY

p596
tp597
a(V MORTY

V Nobody uses it.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V I'm buying you a new sofa.  
p602
tp603
a(V HELEN 
p604
V Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.  
p605
tp606
a(V ELAINE

tp609
a(V HELEN

V You're hot?  
p611
tp612
a(V ELAINE 
p613
V I've lost 6 pounds.  
p614

a(V HELEN 
p616
V I don't even know how to work it.

p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V Evelyn, this is Elaine.  
p632
tp633
a(V ELAINE 
p634
V (with pain) Hi Evelyn.  
p635
tp636
a(V EVELYN 
p637
V Jerry you got thin.  
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V Too thin?  
p641
tp642
a(V HELEN 
p643
V Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.   
p644
tp645
a(V EVELYN 
p646
V So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)   
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?   
p650
tp651
a(V EVELYN 
p652
V The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.    
p653
tp654
a(V HELEN 
p655
V How did you know that?  
p656
tp657
a(V EVELYN 
p658
V Blanche told me.  
p659
tp660
a(V HELEN 
p661
V Blanche?  
p662
tp663
a(V EVELYN 
p664
V That's some good pen. It writes upside down.   
p665
tp666
a(V ELAINE 
p667
V The astronauts use them.  
p668
tp669
a(V HELEN 
p670
V What did Blanche say?  
p671
tp672
a(V EVELYN 
p673
V I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.   
p674
tp675
a(V JERRY 
p676
V I never really wanted the pen.  
p677
tp678
a(V MORTY 
p679
V He gave him the pen.  
p680
tp681
a(V HELEN 
p682
V Morty.  
p683
tp684
a(V EVELYN 
p685
V Why you don't like the pen?  
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V No, no, I...  
p689
tp690
a(V EVELYN 
p691
V Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.   
p692
tp693
a(V HELEN 
p694
V Is that what she said?  
p695
tp696
a(V EVELYN 
p697
V Who?  
p698
tp699
a(V HELEN 
p700
V Blanche.  
p701
tp702
a(V EVELYN 
p703
V What are you talking about?   (The phone rings, Helen answers.)  
p704
tp705
a(V HELEN 
p706
V Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)   
p707
tp708
a(V ELAINE 
p709
V Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!    
p710
tp711
a(V MORTY 
p712
V (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.    (the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)  
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V All I said was "I like the pen".   (Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)  
p716
tp717
a(V MORTY 
p718
V How the hell do you work this thing?     (scene ends)       (still the condo, later)   (Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)   
p719
tp720
a(V HELEN 
p721
V Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.  
p722
tp723
a(V ELAINE 
p724
V No no, I wanna go.  
p725
tp726
a(V HELEN 
p727
V But your back hurts.  
p728
tp729
a(V MORTY 
p730
V Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.   
p731
tp732
a(V ELAINE 
p733
V Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.    
p734
tp735
a(V HELEN 
p736
V No. I'm fine.  
p737
tp738
a(V ELAINE 
p739
V You're not too cold?  
p740
tp741
a(V HELEN 
p742
V No.   (Jerry enters with a black eye)  
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V Don't be alarmed.  
p746
tp747
a(V MORTY 
p748
V Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?   
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.  
p752
tp753
a(V HELEN 
p754
V Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?   
p755
tp756
a(V JERRY 
p757
V (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?   
p758
tp759
a(V ELAINE 
p760
V Having a good time!  
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?   
p764
tp765
a(V HELEN 
p766
V What happened to your eyes?  
p767
tp768
a(V JERRY 
p769
V Well I started to go under...  
p770
tp771
a(V HELEN 
p772
V With the instructor?  
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.   
p776
tp777
a(V HELEN 
p778
V I told you...   (Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)  
p779
tp780
a(V JACK 
p781
V Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?    
p782
tp783
a(V ELAINE 
p784
V My back hurts.  
p785
tp786
a(V JACK 
p787
V Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.    
p788
tp789
a(V MORTY 
p790
V We got plenty of time.  
p791
tp792
a(V JACK 
p793
V (to Jerry) What happened to you?  
p794
tp795
a(V JERRY 
p796
V I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.   
p797
tp798
a(V HELEN 
p799
V It's from scuba diving.  
p800
tp801
a(V JACK 
p802
V What's there to see underwater?    give him back the pen)  
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.   
p806
tp807
a(V JACK 
p808
V You what?  
p809
tp810
a(V JERRY 
p811
V I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he tends the pen to Jack)   
p812
tp813
a(V JACK 
p814
V Well I mean...  
p815
tp816
a(V JERRY 
p817
V Take it.  
p818
tp819
a(V JACK 
p820
V All right! (he smiles and take it)     (Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)  
p821
tp822
a(V MORTY 
p823
V You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.   
p824
tp825
a(V JACK 
p826
V Whose pen?  
p827
tp828
a(V MORTY 
p829
V His pen.  
p830
tp831
a(V JACK 
p832
V This happens to be my pen.  
p833
tp834
a(V MORTY 
p835
V You didn't give it to him.  
p836
tp837
a(V JACK 
p838
V What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.   
p839
tp840
a(V MORTY 
p841
V Where do you come off with this crap?    
p842
tp843
a(V JACK 
p844
V Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?    
p845
tp846
a(V MORTY 
p847
V You said you didn't want it!  
p848
tp849
a(V JACK 
p850
V Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!   
p851
tp852
a(V MORTY 
p853
V Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?     (Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)  
p854
tp855
a(V JACK 
p856
V Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!    
p857
tp858
a(V MORTY 
p859
V Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!    
p860
tp861
a(V JACK 
p862
V Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!    
p863
tp864
a(V MORTY 
p865
V I don't want it!  
p866
tp867
a(V JACK 
p868
V I don't want it!  
p869
tp870
a(V MORTY 
p871
V You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!   
p872
tp873
a(V JACK 
p874
V Listen do you think I give a damn?    
p875
tp876
a(V MORTY 
p877
V Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.   
p878
tp879
a(V JERRY 
p880
V What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?   
p881
tp882
a(V HELEN 
p883
V I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)   
p884
tp885
a(V JERRY 
p886
V Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?    
p887
tp888
a(V MORTY 
p889
V yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.    
p890
tp891
a(V JERRY 
p892
V Well. This should be a very interesting evening.   
p893
tp894
a(V ELAINE 
p895
V (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?    (scene ends)       (reception room, evening)   (Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)   
p896
tp897
a(V PHOTOGRAPHER 
p898
V Say astronaut.   (Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)   
p899
tp900
a(V ELAINE 
p901
V Say what? (laughing) Say what?  
p902
tp903
a(V JERRY 
p904
V (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.   
p905
tp906
a(V MORTY 
p907
V Astronaut?  
p908
tp909
a(V HELEN 
p910
V Say it.   
p911
tp912
a(V ELAINE 
p913
V (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!     (the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)   
p914
tp915
a(V MORTY 
p916
V Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?   
p917
tp918
a(V JERRY 
p919
V Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)   
p920
tp921

p922
V (to Leo) Uncle Leo.  
p923

a(V MORTY 
p931
V What nervous?  
p932
tp933
a(V LEO 
p934
V (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?   
p935
tp936
a(V JERRY 
p937
V I've got a black eye.  
p938
tp939
a(V STELLA

V Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.  
p944
tp945
a(V HELEN

a(V STELLA 
p952
V Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.   
p953
tp954
a(V LEO 
p955
V I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.   
p956
tp957
a(V JERRY 
p958
V No, no.  
p959
tp960
a(V LEO 
p961
V You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.   
p962
tp963
a(V ELAINE 
p964
V (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!   
p965
tp966
a(V LEO 
p967
V Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.   
p968
tp969
a(V MORTY 
p970
V What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!   
p971
tp972
a(V LEO 
p973
V You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.    (Jack and Morty exchange a look.)  
p974
tp975
a(V STELLA 
p976
V (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.   
p977
tp978
a(V HELEN 
p979
V (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.      "Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)   
p980
tp981
a(V JACK 
p982
V (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.   
p983
tp984
a(V MORTY 
p985
V (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)   
p986
tp987
a(V JACK 
p988
V Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)   
p989
tp990
a(V HELEN 
p991
V (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.   
p992
tp993
a(V JACK 
p994
V His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.    
p995
tp996
a(V MORTY 
p997
V (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.    
p998
tp999
a(V JACK 
p1000
V But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)   
p1001
tp1002
a(V MORTY 
p1003
V (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)

p1006
V Dad!  
p1007

p1010
tp1011
a(V JACK 
p1012
V He gave it to me!  
p1013

a(V MORTY 
p1015
V Come on. That's enough, sit down!  
p1016
tp1017
a(V JACK 
p1018
V I'm not sitting down!   (they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)   
p1019
tp1020
a(V JACK 
p1021
V Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)

p1034
tp1035
a(V JERRY 
p1036
V (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?    WOMAN IN THE CROWD  (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.    (Elaine is almost asleep at the table)  
p1037
tp1038
a(V JERRY 
p1039
V Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?    MAN IN THE CROWD  I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
