aV  THE JACKET  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Night club)   I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think    eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people    from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and    boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. They walk out,    twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was nice. I could wear that."    (Scene ends)   (Clothing store)

V SALESMAN 
p8
aV Well, I might have something in the back.   
p9
aa(lp10
V ELAINE 
p11
aV The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.   
p12
aa(lp13
V JERRY 
p14
aV Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, "Just Back." All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Picks    up a tie display) Look, Elaine, tie car wash.  
p15
aa(lp16
V CUSTOMER 
p17
aV (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.

aV No, I'll go. I'm going.  
p42

aV No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.   
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.   
p48
aa(lp49
V ELAINE 
p50
aV So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.

V JERRY 
p53
aV (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.   
p54

V ELAINE 
p56
aV Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.   
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY 
p59
aV This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?   
p60
aa(lp61

p87
aa(lp88
V JERRY 
p89
aV (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?   
p90
aa(lp91
V ELAINE 
p92
aV Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.   
p93
aa(lp94
V JERRY 
p95
aV Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. "What about the money?" "What's money?"   
p96
aa(lp97
V SALESMAN 
p98
aV It looks wonderful on you.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's sitting on his couch wearing his pajamas and his new jacket. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters)

V KRAMER 
p140
aV What, you're not gonna tell me?  
p141
aa(lp142
V JERRY 
p143
aV I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.

aV Over three hundred?  
p147
aa(lp148

aV Well, are you gonna wear it?  
p177
aa(lp178

aa(lp181
V KRAMER 
p182
aV (Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear this.

V JERRY 
p200
aV What is that song?  
p201
aa(lp202
V GEORGE 
p203
aV Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no    control over it. I'm singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it infront of clients. It's taking over my life.   
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY

V GEORGE 
p221
aV Oh, Schumann. Of course.  
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He    had to be institutionalized.  
p225
aa(lp226
V GEORGE 
p227
aV Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures "That's the breaks." George gasps) Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just    say something. Just start talking. Change the subject.. Let's just go, alright? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.   
p228

V GEORGE 
p239
aV "Master of the house, keeper of the inn.." (Jerry proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in admiration at the jacket) This is huge!    When did this happen?  
p240
aa(lp241
V JERRY 
p242
aV Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been    a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.   
p243
aa(lp244
V GEORGE 
p245
aV (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.

aV I know.  
p255
aa(lp256
V GEORGE 
p257
aV And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So    what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry's acting coy throughout the whole thing) Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell my    you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me?! You are sick! Is that what you    paid for this jacket?! Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket? I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A    thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! Alright, fine. I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket,    unless you tell me different. (Jerry still coy, stays silent) Oh, ho! Alright! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a    thousand..   (Enter Kramer)

aV Well, what kind of solid?  
p264
aa(lp265
V KRAMER

p269
aV Birds?  
p270
aa(lp271
V KRAMER

p273
aa(lp274
V JERRY 
p275
aV So take a cab.  
p276
aa(lp277
V KRAMER 
p278
aV They won't take a cage full of birds.    
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.   
p282
aa(lp283
V KRAMER 
p284
aV George, do me a solid? Two minutes.    
p285

p309
aa(lp310

aV (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a second, is that him?    
p312
aa(lp313

p405
aa(lp406

aa(lp418
V ALTON 
p419
aV We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing funny about that.    (Jerry and George turn to the door again)

p459
aa(lp460
V JERRY 
p461
aV The waiter was trembling.  
p462

p465
aa(lp466
V JERRY 
p467
aV How are we gonna get out of it?  
p468
aa(lp469

p470
aV We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.   
p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.   
p474
aa(lp475
V GEORGE 
p476
aV I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.     (Scene ends)   (Night club)

aV All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, "To hell with the    world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want."    (Scene ends)   (Hotel lobby)   (Jerry and George come back from the bathroom)

He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car!    So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car.. so, finally, he finally    comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. So, we're wandering around trying    to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. (Sits down, takes a deep breath) ..So    how's everything going over here?
