V  THE JACKET  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Night club)   I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think    eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people    from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and    boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. They walk out,    twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was nice. I could wear that."    (Scene ends)   (Clothing store)

V I think I've seen enough.  
p5
tp6
a(V SALESMAN 
p7
V Well, I might have something in the back.   
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.   
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, "Just Back." All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Picks    up a tie display) Look, Elaine, tie car wash.  
p14
tp15
a(V CUSTOMER 
p16
V (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.    
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V (Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.   
p20
tp21
a(V CUSTOMER 
p22
V Alton Benes is your father?  
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V Yeah.  
p26
tp27
a(V CUSTOMER 
p28
V I always felt he deserved a wider audience.    
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.   
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..  
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V What? What, you don't want to go now?    
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V No, I'll go. I'm going.  
p41
tp42
a(V ELAINE 
p43
V No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.   
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.   
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.    
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.   
p53
tp54
a(V ELAINE 
p55
V Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.   
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?   
p59
tp60
a(V ELAINE 
p61
V (Shocked) Oh my God.  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad?  
p65
tp66
a(V ELAINE 
p67
V You have no idea.  
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V I have some idea.  
p71
tp72
a(V ELAINE 
p73
V No idea.  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V I've got a ballpark.  
p77
tp78
a(V ELAINE 
p79
V There is no park and the team has relocated.    
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V (Looks at the tag) ..That is high.    
p83
tp84
a(V ELAINE 
p85
V Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.   
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?   
p89
tp90
a(V ELAINE 
p91
V Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.   
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. "What about the money?" "What's money?"   
p95
tp96
a(V SALESMAN 
p97
V It looks wonderful on you.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's sitting on his couch wearing his pajamas and his new jacket. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters)

V Hey.  
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V Hey. New jacket?  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V What do you think?  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V It's beautiful.  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V Is it me?  
p113
tp114
a(V KRAMER 
p115
V That's definitely you.  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Really?  
p119
tp120
a(V KRAMER 
p121
V That's more you than you've ever been. (Starts looking the jacket over) What is with the pink lining?   
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V I don't know. It's got a pink lining.    
p125
tp126
a(V KRAMER 
p127
V Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?    
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V I paid what it costs.  
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V How much?  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V What's the difference?  
p137
tp138
a(V KRAMER 
p139
V What, you're not gonna tell me?  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.   
p143
tp144
a(V KRAMER 
p145
V Over three hundred?  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Yes, but let's just stop it right there.    
p149
tp150
a(V KRAMER 
p151
V It's over four hundred?  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V Really, I'm not answering anymore.    
p155
tp156
a(V KRAMER 
p157
V Is it over four hundred?  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Would you?  
p161
tp162
a(V KRAMER 
p163
V (Finds the tag) Woah, Nelson!  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V I know, I know.  
p167
tp168
a(V KRAMER 
p169
V (Talking about his old jacket) What are you gonna do with the leather one?    
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V I don't know.  
p173
tp174
a(V KRAMER 
p175
V Well, are you gonna wear it?  
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V Maybe.  
p179
tp180
a(V KRAMER 
p181
V (Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear this.   
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Do you want it?  
p185
tp186
a(V KRAMER 
p187
V Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket.   
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V (Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take it.   
p191
tp192
a(V KRAMER 
p193
V Good karma for you. (Kramer puts on his new jacket, and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (George enters singing "Master Of the House" - a Les Miserables show tune)

a(V GEORGE 
p196
V "Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to make a stir everyone appreciates a.."   
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V What is that song?  
p200
tp201
a(V GEORGE 
p202
V Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no    control over it. I'm singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it infront of clients. It's taking over my life.   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V You know, Schumann went mad from that.    
p206
tp207
a(V GEORGE 
p208
V Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?    
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V No, you idiot.  
p212
tp213
a(V GEORGE 
p214
V What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?   
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?    
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Oh, Schumann. Of course.  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He    had to be institutionalized.  
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures "That's the breaks." George gasps) Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just    say something. Just start talking. Change the subject.. Let's just go, alright? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.   
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.   
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.   
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)   
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V "Master of the house, keeper of the inn.." (Jerry proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in admiration at the jacket) This is huge!    When did this happen?  
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been    a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.   
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.   
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Absolutely.  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V ..It's fabulous.  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V I know.  
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So    what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry's acting coy throughout the whole thing) Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell my    you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me?! You are sick! Is that what you    paid for this jacket?! Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket? I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A    thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! Alright, fine. I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket,    unless you tell me different. (Jerry still coy, stays silent) Oh, ho! Alright! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a    thousand..   (Enter Kramer)  
p257
tp258
a(V KRAMER 
p259
V Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?    
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Well, what kind of solid?  
p263
tp264
a(V KRAMER 
p265
V I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.   
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V Birds?  
p269
tp270
a(V KRAMER 
p271
V Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.   
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V So take a cab.  
p275
tp276
a(V KRAMER 
p277
V They won't take a cage full of birds.    
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.   
p281
tp282
a(V KRAMER 
p283
V George, do me a solid? Two minutes.    
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.   
p287
tp288
a(V KRAMER 
p289
V Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.    (Kramer leaves)  
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V (Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.    (Scene ends)   (Hotel lobby)   (Jerry and George enter. George's singing "Master of the House")    
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V "Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by."   
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V (Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared) Where are they?    
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V Maybe he didn't show up.  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V What, you don't want to do this?  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.   
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a second, is that him?    
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V I'm nervous.  
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Excuse me.. Mister Benes?  
p320
tp321
a(V ALTON 
p322
V Yeah?  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.   
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V (Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.     (Alton starts hacking, George withdraws his hand)  
p329
tp330
a(V ALTON 
p331
V Sit down. Want a drink?  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Sure.  
p335
tp336
a(V ALTON 
p337
V (Summons waiter) What do you have?    
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V (To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.   
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.    
p344
tp345
a(V BENES 
p346
V (Gives both Jerry and George a look) I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.   
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V You like ice?  
p350
tp351
a(V ALTON 
p352
V Huh?  
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V I said, do you like ice?  
p356
tp357
a(V ALTON 
p358
V Like it?  
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V Don't you think you get more without it?   
p362
tp363
a(V ALTON 
p364
V (Pauses) Where's Elaine?  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?   
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.   
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V I guess today she's late.  
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V It appears that way.  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V Yep.  
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Yep.   (Both Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine's arrival)   
p386
tp387
a(V ALTON 
p388
V Looks like rain.  
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V (Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said.   
p392
tp393
a(V ALTON 
p394
V Who said?  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.  
p398
tp399
a(V ALTON 
p400
V I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V No, of course not. I didn't..  
p404
tp405
a(V ALTON 
p406
V All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (Waiter shows up with the drinks) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?   
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V (Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian.    
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V I'm just a regular person.  
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V No, no. He's just being modest.  
p416
tp417
a(V ALTON 
p418
V We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing funny about that.    (Jerry and George turn to the door again)  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.     (Jerry leaves. George is left alone with Alton)  
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.   
p425
tp426
a(V ALTON 
p427
V Drivel.  
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V Maybe some parts.  
p431
tp432
a(V ALTON 
p433
V What parts?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and leaves)    (Scene cuts to the hotel bathroom)  
p437
tp438
a(V GEORGE 
p439
V Thank you for leaving me alone with him!   
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V That was brutal. I can't go back out there.   
p443
tp444
a(V GEORGE 
p445
V Well, let's just leave.  
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V Elaine'll kill me.  
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V Where is she?  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V She's gotta be here soon.  
p455
tp456
a(V GEORGE 
p457
V How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.   
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V The waiter was trembling.  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.   
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V How are we gonna get out of it?  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.   
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.   
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475
V I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.     (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, "To hell with the    world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want."    (Scene ends)   (Hotel lobby)   (Jerry and George come back from the bathroom)  
p479
tp480
a(V ALTON 
p481
V Who'd you call?  
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V (Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.

V Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..   
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V Oh, you didn't..  
p548
tp549
a(V ELAINE 
p550
V Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me    to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car!    So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car.. so, finally, he finally    comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. So, we're wandering around trying    to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. (Sits down, takes a deep breath) ..So    how's everything going over here?
