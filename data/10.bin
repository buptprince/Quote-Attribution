aV  THE STATUE  Written by Larry Charles     (Night club)   I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, "You may have already won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, "You have definitely lost!" You turn it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, "Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest."     (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)   (George is reading the paper. Kramer and Jerry both try to enter carrying a large carton with the name Seinfeld on it)

aa(lp19
V JERRY 
p20
aV Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.    (They open the box, and start going through it)

aa(lp64
V JERRY 
p65
aV What?  
p66
aa(lp67
V GEORGE 
p68
aV When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park", and I got to the part about, "I'll never have that recipe again," and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.     (George grips the statue, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it)   
p69
aa(lp70

p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83

p84
aa(lp85
V KRAMER 
p86
aV Potato man!  
p87
aa(lp88
V GEORGE 
p89
aV No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.     (Kramer and George both visibly add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go)   
p90
aa(lp91
V KRAMER 
p92
aV Okay.. start with me.  
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV Yeah, good, good.   (Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every syllable)    
p96
aa(lp97
V JERRY 
p98
aV Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)   
p99
aa(lp100
V KRAMER

p153
aa(lp154

aa(lp157
V ELAINE 
p158
aV You told them that?  
p159
aa(lp160
V RAVA 
p161
aV Of course.  
p162
aa(lp163
V ELAINE 
p164
aV This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.    (Jerry enters for the bedroom carrying luggage)  
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.

p174
aa(lp175

p180
aa(lp181
V RAY 
p182
aV Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. (Bows)   
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV (Taken aback) ..Alright.  
p186
aa(lp187

p197
aV The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)    (Scene ends) (Night club)  
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, "I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there." And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p201
aa(lp202
V JERRY 
p203
aV He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!   
p204
aa(lp205
V ELAINE 
p206
aV There's no Rubber Man.  
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.   
p210
aa(lp211
V ELAINE 
p212
aV I'm leaving.  
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV Where are you going?  
p216
aa(lp217
V ELAINE 
p218
aV To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.   
p219
aa(lp220
V JERRY 
p221
aV Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)    (Scene ends) (Rava's apartment)   (Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room)  
p222
aa(lp223
V ELAINE 
p224
aV (To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..    
p225
aa(lp226
V RAVA 
p227
aV Demand. (The sound of locks being unlocked can be heard) There's Ray.. late as usual.    (Ray enters)  
p228
aa(lp229
V RAY 
p230
aV Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, "Jerry the First," gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.   
p231
aa(lp232
V JERRY 
p233
aV Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.   
p234
aa(lp235
V RAY 
p236
aV But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.   
p237
aa(lp238
V JERRY 
p239
aV (Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?    (They all laugh - Ray laughs longer than everyone else. Jerry savors the laughs of his big fan - then he sees George's statue on the mantle of the fireplace. He's stunned by the sight)    
p240
aa(lp241
V RAVA 
p242
aV The water is boiling. Are you having tea?   
p243
aa(lp244
V ELAINE AND RAY

aa(lp250
V JERRY 
p251

p252
aa(lp253
V RAVA 
p254
aV (From the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?   
p255
aa(lp256
V RAY 
p257
aV Yeah, I'm coming!   (He leaves. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers)   
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV (Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!   
p261
aa(lp262
V ELAINE 
p263
aV What statue?  
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY 
p266
aV I had a statue!  
p267
aa(lp268
V ELAINE 
p269
aV You have a statue? I never saw a statue.    
p270
aa(lp271
V JERRY 
p272
aV My grandfather gave me a statue!  
p273
aa(lp274
V ELAINE 
p275
aV Since when?  
p276
aa(lp277
V JERRY 
p278
aV What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!    (Ray pops his head back into the living room)  
p279
aa(lp280
V RAY 
p281
aV Do you take sugar?  
p282
aa(lp283
V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p284
aV Uhh.. no.   (Ray goes back into the kitchen)  
p285
aa(lp286
V JERRY 
p287
aV I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!   
p288
aa(lp289
V ELAINE 
p290
aV Do you realize what you're saying?    
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!     (Ray pops in again)  
p294
aa(lp295
V RAY 
p296
aV Lemon?  
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p299
aV (Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah..   (Ray goes back into the kitchen)  
p300
aa(lp301
V ELAINE 
p302
aV Are you sure?  
p303
aa(lp304
V JERRY 
p305
aV Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.    
p306
aa(lp307
V ELAINE 
p308
aV Ninety-nine percent sure?!   (Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea)  
p309
aa(lp310
V RAY 
p311
aV Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.    (Jerry smells it suspiciously - like it's poisoned. A ding from the kitchen can be heard)   
p312
aa(lp313
V RAY 
p314
aV The pastries!   (Ray and Rava exit in different directions)  
p315
aa(lp316
V ELAINE 
p317
aV Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.   
p318
aa(lp319
V JERRY 
p320
aV Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.    
p321
aa(lp322

V JERRY 
p341
aV Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.   
p342
aa(lp343
V RAVA 
p344
aV My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.    (A long beat passes)

V JERRY 
p347
aV My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?     (Ray enters with a tray of pastries)  
p348
aa(lp349
V RAY 
p350

p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY

aV I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone?

p431
aV I'll be right here.   (Ray enters)  
p432
aa(lp433
V JERRY 
p434
aV (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) Ray?   
p435
aa(lp436
V RAY 
p437
aV (Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?   
p438
aa(lp439
V JERRY 
p440
aV ..Well, I didn't..  
p441
aa(lp442
V RAY 
p443
aV Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.    
p444
aa(lp445
V GEORGE 
p446
aV (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.    
p447
aa(lp448
V JERRY 
p449
aV Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.   
p450
aa(lp451
V RAY 
p452
aV Give it back?  
p453
aa(lp454
V JERRY 
p455
aV Yeah.  
p456
aa(lp457
V RAY 
p458
aV What are you talking about?  
p459
aa(lp460
V JERRY 
p461
aV What are you talking about?  
p462
aa(lp463
V GEORGE 
p464
aV (Muttering) What is he talking about..    
p465
aa(lp466
V RAY 
p467
aV I'm talking about the statue.  
p468
aa(lp469
V JERRY 
p470
aV Yeah, me too.  
p471
aa(lp472
V RAY 
p473
aV Give it back to whom?  
p474
aa(lp475
V JERRY 
p476
aV Me.  
p477
aa(lp478
V GEORGE 
p479
aV (To himself) Yeah, him.  
p480
aa(lp481
V RAY 
p482
aV You?  
p483
aa(lp484
V JERRY 
p485
aV Yeah. Me.  
p486
aa(lp487
V RAY 
p488
aV I'm not getting this.  
p489
aa(lp490
V GEORGE 
p491
aV (To himself) You already got it.  
p492
aa(lp493
V JERRY 
p494
aV Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.   
p495
aa(lp496
V RAY 
p497
aV What are you saying?  
p498
aa(lp499
V JERRY 
p500
aV What am I saying?  
p501
aa(lp502
V GEORGE 
p503
aV (To himself) Take a wild guess.  
p504
aa(lp505
V RAY 
p506
aV Are you saying I stole your statue?    
p507
aa(lp508
V GEORGE 
p509
aV (To himself) What a mind.  
p510
aa(lp511
V JERRY 
p512
aV Well, I..  
p513
aa(lp514
V RAY 
p515
aV I can't believe what I'm hearing.  
p516
aa(lp517
V JERRY 
p518
aV I can't believe what I'm hearing.  
p519
aa(lp520
V GEORGE 
p521
aV (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.   
p522
aa(lp523
V RAY 
p524
aV For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.   
p525
aa(lp526
V GEORGE 
p527
aV (To Himself) A pawn shop?  
p528
aa(lp529
V JERRY 
p530
aV A pawn shop?  
p531
aa(lp532
V RAY 
p533
aV Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.   
p534
aa(lp535
V GEORGE 
p536
aV (To himself) And cleaning them out.     (Jerry elbows George - a message to shut up)  
p537
aa(lp538
V JERRY 
p539
aV Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.   
p540
aa(lp541
V RAY 
p542
aV What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?   
p543
aa(lp544
V GEORGE 
p545
aV (To himself) Again with the Rava.  
p546
aa(lp547
V RAY 
p548
aV You want her.  
p549
aa(lp550
V JERRY 
p551
aV (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.   
p552
aa(lp553
V RAY 
p554
aV (Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!    
p555
aa(lp556
V JERRY 
p557
aV I know Finland. They're neutral.  
p558
aa(lp559
V RAY 
p560
aV Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?    
p561
aa(lp562
V JERRY 
p563
aV No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.   
p564
aa(lp565
V GEORGE 
p566
aV (Mocking) "Oh, I find you so charming" ..You wuss.   
p567
aa(lp568
V JERRY 
p569
aV (To George) Did you call me a wuss?    
p570
aa(lp571
V RAY 
p572
aV What did you say?  
p573
aa(lp574
V JERRY 
p575
aV I said luss.. I'm at a luss..  
p576
aa(lp577
V RAY 
p578
aV I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.   
p579
aa(lp580
V JERRY 
p581
aV That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.   
p582
aa(lp583
V RAY 
p584
aV And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.   
p585
aa(lp586
V GEORGE 
p587
aV (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?   
p588
aa(lp589
V RAY 
p590
aV If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.   
p591
aa(lp592
V GEORGGE 
p593
aV That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!   
p594
aa(lp595
V JERRY 
p596
aV (Pleading) George.  
p597
aa(lp598
V RAY 
p599
aV (To Jerry) Who is this?  
p600
aa(lp601
V GEORGE 
p602
aV I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!   
p603
aa(lp604
V RAY 
p605
aV What's going on here?  
p606
aa(lp607
V GEORGE 
p608
aV GUILTY!   
p609
aa(lp610
V RAY 
p611
aV Your friend is crazy.  
p612
aa(lp613
V GEORGE 
p614
aV Oh, I'm crazy!  
p615
aa(lp616
V JERRY 
p617
aV (Still pleading) George, george..  
p618
aa(lp619
V RAY 
p620
aV I've got to get going. I have a class.    
p621
aa(lp622
V GEORGE 
p623
aV Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!   
p624
aa(lp625
V RAY 
p626
aV Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.   
p627
aa(lp628
V GEORGE 
p629
aV You mean alias.  
p630
aa(lp631
V RAY 
p632
aV You are starting to make me angry.    
p633
aa(lp634
V GEORGE 
p635
aV Well, that was bound to happen!  
p636
aa(lp637
V RAY 
p638
aV (To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes to leave)    
p639
aa(lp640
V JERRY 
p641
aV Hey, Ray.  
p642
aa(lp643
V RAY 
p644
aV (Stops) Yes?  
p645
aa(lp646
V JERRY 
p647
aV How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!    (Scene ends) (Pendant publishing)   (Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator)  
p648
aa(lp649
V ELAINE 
p650
aV Nervous?  
p651
aa(lp652
V RAVA 
p653
aV Why should I be?  
p654
aa(lp655
V ELAINE 
p656
aV Yeah. Right.  
p657
aa(lp658
V RAVA 
p659
aV Your notes are very insightful.  
p660
aa(lp661
V ELAINE 
p662
aV The book is great. Did you go out last night?   
p663
aa(lp664
V RAVA 
p665
aV No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.   
p666
aa(lp667
V ELAINE 
p668
aV They all are..  
p669
aa(lp670
V RAVA 
p671
aV Was Jerry?  
p672
aa(lp673
V ELAINE 
p674
aV I can't remember..   (Doors open. They step in)  
p675
aa(lp676
V RAVA 
p677
aV You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.   
p678
aa(lp679
V ELAINE 
p680
aV Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.    (The doors close. Scene cuts to moments later, on another floor. The doors open)   
p681
aa(lp682
V RAVA 
p683
aV (Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!    
p684
aa(lp685
V ELAINE 
p686
aV Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.   
p687
aa(lp688
V RAVA 
p689
aV I admit nothing!   (The doors close. Scene cuts to the inside of the elevator)    
p690
aa(lp691
V MAN 
p692
aV Will you put that cigarette out, please?     (Rava ignores him)  
p693
aa(lp694
V ELAINE 
p695
aV Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.    
p696
aa(lp697
V RAVA 
p698
aV Maybe you think we're in cahoots.  
p699
aa(lp700
V ELAINE 
p701
aV No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.    
p702
aa(lp703
V RAVA 
p704
aV Yes, that's all, a coincidence!  
p705
aa(lp706
V ELAINE 
p707
aV A big coincidence.  
p708
aa(lp709
V RAVA 
p710
aV Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!    
p711
aa(lp712
V ELAINE 
p713
aV No, that's a big coincidence.  
p714
aa(lp715
V RAVA 
p716
aV That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!    
p717
aa(lp718
V ELAINE 
p719
aV No, there are degrees of coincidences.    
p720
aa(lp721
V RAVA 
p722
aV No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!..    (Everyone just kinda shrugs, then murmurs. The doors open)  
p723
aa(lp724
V MAN 
p725
aV Will you put that cigarette out?!  
p726
aa(lp727
V RAVA 
p728
aV (Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.   
p729
aa(lp730
V ELAINE 
p731
aV Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?     (The doors close. Scene cuts to another floor. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There's a janitor's cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, then throws the manuscript into the garbage can of the cart, and exits)    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p732
aa(lp733
V GEORGE 
p734
aV (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.   
p735
aa(lp736
V KRAMER 
p737
aV I'm not happy about this.  
p738
aa(lp739
V ELAINE 
p740
aV Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?   
p741
aa(lp742
V GEORGE 
p743
aV There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.   
p744
aa(lp745
V JERRY 
p746
aV Really?  
p747
aa(lp748
V GEORGE 
p749
aV (Casually) Sure. Why not?  
p750
aa(lp751
V ELAINE 
p752
aV Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.   
p753
aa(lp754
V JERRY 
p755
aV Can't you talk to your boss?  
p756
aa(lp757
V ELAINE 
p758
aV I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.   
p759
aa(lp760
V KRAMER 
p761
aV I'm not happy about this.  
p762
aa(lp763
V JERRY 
p764
aV Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..    
p765
aa(lp766
V GEORGE 
p767
aV Yeah.. He'll have my parents!   (Scene ends) (Rava and Ray's apartment)   (Ray's home alone. There's a knock at the door)  
p768
aa(lp769
V KRAMER 
p770
aV Police! Open up!  
p771
aa(lp772
V RAY 
p773
aV Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall - face first)    
p774
aa(lp775
V KRAMER 
p776
aV Freeze, mother!  
p777
aa(lp778
V RAY 
p779
aV Hey..   (Kramer shoves him roughly against the wall)  
p780
aa(lp781
V KRAMER 
p782
aV Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.    
p783
aa(lp784
V RAY 
p785
aV Murder?!   (Kramer shoves him against the wall)  
p786
aa(lp787
V KRAMER 
p788
aV Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!   
p789
aa(lp790
V RAY 
p791
aV I think you have me confused with somebody else.   
p792
aa(lp793
V KRAMER 
p794
aV (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?   
p795
aa(lp796
V RAY 
p797
aV Yeah.  
p798
aa(lp799
V KRAMER 
p800
aV (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)    
p801
aa(lp802
V RAY 
p803
aV Hey, hey, are you a cop?  
p804
aa(lp805
V KRAMER 
p806
aV Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?   
p807
aa(lp808
V RAY 
p809
aV Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.   
p810
aa(lp811
V KRAMER 
p812
aV Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)   (Kramer guides Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment)    
p813
aa(lp814
V JERRY 
p815
aV Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?    (Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue)   
p816
aa(lp817
V GEORGE 
p818
aV Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!   
p819
aa(lp820
V KRAMER 
p821
aV Yeah.  
p822
aa(lp823
V JERRY 
p824
aV Kramer, what did you do?  
p825
aa(lp826
V KRAMER 
p827
aV Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.   
p828
aa(lp829
V GEORGE 
p830
aV I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!   
p831
aa(lp832
V KRAMER 
p833
aV Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground)    (Scene ends) (Night club)  
p834
aa.
