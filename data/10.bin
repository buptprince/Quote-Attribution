V  THE STATUE  Written by Larry Charles     (Night club)   I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, "You may have already won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, "You have definitely lost!" You turn it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, "Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest."     (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)   (George is reading the paper. Kramer and Jerry both try to enter carrying a large carton with the name Seinfeld on it)

a(V JERRY

tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V I'd like to help, but my neck..   (The set the box on the table)  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V So how long has it been in the basement?    
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.    (They open the box, and start going through it)  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V What's in it?  
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.    
p26
tp27
a(V KRAMER 
p28
V (Pulls out some socks) You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.    
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.   
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.   
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.   
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They don't like it.   
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?    (Kramer pulls a statue out of the box)  
p44
tp45
a(V KRAMER 
p46
V Now this, I like.   (George's eyes light up when he sees the statue)  
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.   
p50
tp51
a(V KRAMER 
p52
V (Getting possesive) Wait, wait, wait..    
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V Let me just see it.  
p56
tp57
a(V KRAMER 
p58
V Come on..   (The both grab it)  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V What?  
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park", and I got to the part about, "I'll never have that recipe again," and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.     (George grips the statue, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it)   
p68
tp69
a(V KRAMER 
p70
V C'mon, George. I saw it first.  
p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.    
p74
tp75
a(V KRAMER 
p76
V No, I got dibs!  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!   
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V (Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?   
p83
tp84
a(V KRAMER 
p85
V Potato man!  
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.     (Kramer and George both visibly add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go)   
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V Okay.. start with me.  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V Yeah, good, good.   (Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every syllable)    
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)   
p98
tp99
a(V KRAMER 
p100
V What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.   
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V No, no, no, no.. I'm "it". I win.  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V No, he's it. He wins. "It" is good.    
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V Do over - start with him.  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.    (Kramer tosses the statue to George)  
p113
tp114
a(V KRAMER 
p115
V Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.   
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Alright, c'mon. Let's go.  
p119
tp120
a(V KRAMER 
p121
V Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme song)   
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V (In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue down) Aren't you gonna take it?   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.    
p131
tp132
a(V GOERGE 
p133
V (To Kramer) What about your stuff?    
p134
tp135
a(V KRAMER 
p136
V Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws them into his apartment, and leaves)   
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.   
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V What?  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V The Inka-dink.. you were "It".  
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V "It"'s bad?  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V "It" very bad.   (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p152
tp153
a(V RAVA 
p154
V Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.   
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V You told them that?  
p158
tp159
a(V RAVA 
p160
V Of course.  
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.    (Jerry enters for the bedroom carrying luggage)  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.   
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V Oh, probably caught in traffic.  
p170
tp171
a(V RAVA 
p172
V (Serious) Or maybe he's dead.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V (Joking) So what do you write, children's books?    (There's a knock at the door)  
p176
tp177
a(V RAVA 
p178
V That's Ray.   (Ray enters with cleaning gear)  
p179
tp180
a(V RAY 
p181
V Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. (Bows)   
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V (Taken aback) ..Alright.  
p185
tp186
a(V RAVA 
p187
V And we have to get back to work. (She exits with Elaine)   
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V (Rushed) I gotta get to the airport.    
p191
tp192
a(V RAY 
p193
V Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.    
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)    (Scene ends) (Night club)  
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, "I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there." And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!   
p203
tp204
a(V ELAINE 
p205
V There's no Rubber Man.  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.   
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V I'm leaving.  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Where are you going?  
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.   
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)    (Scene ends) (Rava's apartment)   (Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room)  
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V (To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..    
p224
tp225
a(V RAVA 
p226
V Demand. (The sound of locks being unlocked can be heard) There's Ray.. late as usual.    (Ray enters)  
p227
tp228
a(V RAY 
p229
V Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, "Jerry the First," gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.   
p233
tp234
a(V RAY 
p235
V But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.   
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V (Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?    (They all laugh - Ray laughs longer than everyone else. Jerry savors the laughs of his big fan - then he sees George's statue on the mantle of the fireplace. He's stunned by the sight)    
p239
tp240
a(V RAVA 
p241
V The water is boiling. Are you having tea?   
p242
tp243
a(V ELAINE AND RAY 
p244
V Yes.   (Jerry's still stunned)  
p245
tp246
a(V ELAINE 
p247
V Jerry? ..Jerry!  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V (Snaps out of it) What?  
p251
tp252
a(V RAVA 
p253
V (From the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?   
p254
tp255
a(V RAY 
p256
V Yeah, I'm coming!   (He leaves. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers)   
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V (Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!   
p260
tp261
a(V ELAINE 
p262
V What statue?  
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V I had a statue!  
p266
tp267
a(V ELAINE 
p268
V You have a statue? I never saw a statue.    
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V My grandfather gave me a statue!  
p272
tp273
a(V ELAINE 
p274
V Since when?  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!    (Ray pops his head back into the living room)  
p278
tp279
a(V RAY 
p280
V Do you take sugar?  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p283
V Uhh.. no.   (Ray goes back into the kitchen)  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!   
p287
tp288
a(V ELAINE 
p289
V Do you realize what you're saying?    
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!     (Ray pops in again)  
p293
tp294
a(V RAY 
p295
V Lemon?  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p298
V (Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah..   (Ray goes back into the kitchen)  
p299
tp300
a(V ELAINE 
p301
V Are you sure?  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.    
p305
tp306
a(V ELAINE 
p307
V Ninety-nine percent sure?!   (Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea)  
p308
tp309
a(V RAY 
p310
V Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.    (Jerry smells it suspiciously - like it's poisoned. A ding from the kitchen can be heard)   
p311
tp312
a(V RAY 
p313
V The pastries!   (Ray and Rava exit in different directions)  
p314
tp315
a(V ELAINE 
p316
V Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.   
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.    
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V I never saw the statue.  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V I had a statue! What should I do?  
p326
tp327
a(V ELAINE 
p328
V I don't know.  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and dials)    
p332
tp333
a(V ELAINE 
p334
V Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me.  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)   
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.   
p341
tp342
a(V RAVA 
p343
V My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.    (A long beat passes)  
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?     (Ray enters with a tray of pastries)  
p347
tp348
a(V RAY 
p349
V I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.   
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.   
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V (Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning.    (They go to leave)  
p356
tp357
a(V RAY 
p358
V Oh, how about dinner?  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V (On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do.   
p365
tp366
a(V KRAMER 
p367
V Let's go get him.  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V Yeah, right.  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V We can't just let him get away with this.   
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.   
p377
tp378
a(V KRAMER 
p379
V You wanta go get him?  
p380
tp381
a(V ELAINE 
p382
V Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.   
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!   
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?   
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V Who is this Rava?  
p392
tp393
a(V KRAMER 
p394
V I say we get him.  
p395
tp396
a(V ELAINE 
p397
V No!  
p398
tp399
a(V GEORGE 
p400
V Let me just call him.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)    
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V (Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.   
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V Oh, he stole it?  
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?   
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY AND GEORGE 
p415
V No.   (Scene ends) (Coffee shop)   (Jerry sits alone. In the next booth to Jerry's back, George is sitting inconspicuously)   
p416
tp417
a(V GEORGE 
p418
V (To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o' clock.   
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his "M.O."   
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V Remember, don't take any crap.  
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.    
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V I'll be right here.   (Ray enters)  
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) Ray?   
p434
tp435
a(V RAY 
p436
V (Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?   
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V ..Well, I didn't..  
p440
tp441
a(V RAY 
p442
V Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.    
p443
tp444
a(V GEORGE 
p445
V (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.    
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.   
p449
tp450
a(V RAY 
p451
V Give it back?  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V Yeah.  
p455
tp456
a(V RAY 
p457
V What are you talking about?  
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V What are you talking about?  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V (Muttering) What is he talking about..    
p464
tp465
a(V RAY 
p466
V I'm talking about the statue.  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V Yeah, me too.  
p470
tp471
a(V RAY 
p472
V Give it back to whom?  
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V Me.  
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V (To himself) Yeah, him.  
p479
tp480
a(V RAY 
p481
V You?  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Yeah. Me.  
p485
tp486
a(V RAY 
p487
V I'm not getting this.  
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V (To himself) You already got it.  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.   
p494
tp495
a(V RAY 
p496
V What are you saying?  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V What am I saying?  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V (To himself) Take a wild guess.  
p503
tp504
a(V RAY 
p505
V Are you saying I stole your statue?    
p506
tp507
a(V GEORGE 
p508
V (To himself) What a mind.  
p509
tp510
a(V JERRY 
p511
V Well, I..  
p512
tp513
a(V RAY 
p514
V I can't believe what I'm hearing.  
p515
tp516
a(V JERRY 
p517
V I can't believe what I'm hearing.  
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.   
p521
tp522
a(V RAY 
p523
V For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.   
p524
tp525
a(V GEORGE 
p526
V (To Himself) A pawn shop?  
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V A pawn shop?  
p530
tp531
a(V RAY 
p532
V Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.   
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V (To himself) And cleaning them out.     (Jerry elbows George - a message to shut up)  
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.   
p539
tp540
a(V RAY 
p541
V What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?   
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V (To himself) Again with the Rava.  
p545
tp546
a(V RAY 
p547
V You want her.  
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.   
p551
tp552
a(V RAY 
p553
V (Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!    
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V I know Finland. They're neutral.  
p557
tp558
a(V RAY 
p559
V Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?    
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.   
p563
tp564
a(V GEORGE 
p565
V (Mocking) "Oh, I find you so charming" ..You wuss.   
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V (To George) Did you call me a wuss?    
p569
tp570
a(V RAY 
p571
V What did you say?  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V I said luss.. I'm at a luss..  
p575
tp576
a(V RAY 
p577
V I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.   
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.   
p581
tp582
a(V RAY 
p583
V And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.   
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?   
p587
tp588
a(V RAY 
p589
V If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.   
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGGE 
p592
V That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!   
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V (Pleading) George.  
p596
tp597
a(V RAY 
p598
V (To Jerry) Who is this?  
p599
tp600
a(V GEORGE 
p601
V I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!   
p602
tp603
a(V RAY 
p604
V What's going on here?  
p605
tp606
a(V GEORGE 
p607
V GUILTY!   
p608
tp609
a(V RAY 
p610
V Your friend is crazy.  
p611
tp612
a(V GEORGE 
p613
V Oh, I'm crazy!  
p614
tp615
a(V JERRY 
p616
V (Still pleading) George, george..  
p617
tp618
a(V RAY 
p619
V I've got to get going. I have a class.    
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!   
p623
tp624
a(V RAY 
p625
V Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.   
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V You mean alias.  
p629
tp630
a(V RAY 
p631
V You are starting to make me angry.    
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V Well, that was bound to happen!  
p635
tp636
a(V RAY 
p637
V (To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes to leave)    
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V Hey, Ray.  
p641
tp642
a(V RAY 
p643
V (Stops) Yes?  
p644
tp645
a(V JERRY 
p646
V How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!    (Scene ends) (Pendant publishing)   (Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator)  
p647
tp648
a(V ELAINE 
p649
V Nervous?  
p650
tp651
a(V RAVA 
p652
V Why should I be?  
p653
tp654
a(V ELAINE 
p655
V Yeah. Right.  
p656
tp657
a(V RAVA 
p658
V Your notes are very insightful.  
p659
tp660
a(V ELAINE 
p661
V The book is great. Did you go out last night?   
p662
tp663
a(V RAVA 
p664
V No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.   
p665
tp666
a(V ELAINE 
p667
V They all are..  
p668
tp669
a(V RAVA 
p670
V Was Jerry?  
p671
tp672
a(V ELAINE 
p673
V I can't remember..   (Doors open. They step in)  
p674
tp675
a(V RAVA 
p676
V You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.   
p677
tp678
a(V ELAINE 
p679
V Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.    (The doors close. Scene cuts to moments later, on another floor. The doors open)   
p680
tp681
a(V RAVA 
p682
V (Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!    
p683
tp684
a(V ELAINE 
p685
V Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.   
p686
tp687
a(V RAVA 
p688
V I admit nothing!   (The doors close. Scene cuts to the inside of the elevator)    
p689
tp690
a(V MAN 
p691
V Will you put that cigarette out, please?     (Rava ignores him)  
p692
tp693
a(V ELAINE 
p694
V Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.    
p695
tp696
a(V RAVA 
p697
V Maybe you think we're in cahoots.  
p698
tp699
a(V ELAINE 
p700
V No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.    
p701
tp702
a(V RAVA 
p703
V Yes, that's all, a coincidence!  
p704
tp705
a(V ELAINE 
p706
V A big coincidence.  
p707
tp708
a(V RAVA 
p709
V Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!    
p710
tp711
a(V ELAINE 
p712
V No, that's a big coincidence.  
p713
tp714
a(V RAVA 
p715
V That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!    
p716
tp717
a(V ELAINE 
p718
V No, there are degrees of coincidences.    
p719
tp720
a(V RAVA 
p721
V No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!..    (Everyone just kinda shrugs, then murmurs. The doors open)  
p722
tp723
a(V MAN 
p724
V Will you put that cigarette out?!  
p725
tp726
a(V RAVA 
p727
V (Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.   
p728
tp729
a(V ELAINE 
p730
V Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?     (The doors close. Scene cuts to another floor. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There's a janitor's cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, then throws the manuscript into the garbage can of the cart, and exits)    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)  
p731
tp732
a(V GEORGE 
p733
V (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.   
p734
tp735
a(V KRAMER 
p736
V I'm not happy about this.  
p737
tp738
a(V ELAINE 
p739
V Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?   
p740
tp741
a(V GEORGE 
p742
V There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.   
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V Really?  
p746
tp747
a(V GEORGE 
p748
V (Casually) Sure. Why not?  
p749
tp750
a(V ELAINE 
p751
V Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.   
p752
tp753
a(V JERRY 
p754
V Can't you talk to your boss?  
p755
tp756
a(V ELAINE 
p757
V I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.   
p758
tp759
a(V KRAMER 
p760
V I'm not happy about this.  
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..    
p764
tp765
a(V GEORGE 
p766
V Yeah.. He'll have my parents!   (Scene ends) (Rava and Ray's apartment)   (Ray's home alone. There's a knock at the door)  
p767
tp768
a(V KRAMER 
p769
V Police! Open up!  
p770
tp771
a(V RAY 
p772
V Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall - face first)    
p773
tp774
a(V KRAMER 
p775
V Freeze, mother!  
p776
tp777
a(V RAY 
p778
V Hey..   (Kramer shoves him roughly against the wall)  
p779
tp780
a(V KRAMER 
p781
V Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.    
p782
tp783
a(V RAY 
p784
V Murder?!   (Kramer shoves him against the wall)  
p785
tp786
a(V KRAMER 
p787
V Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!   
p788
tp789
a(V RAY 
p790
V I think you have me confused with somebody else.   
p791
tp792
a(V KRAMER 
p793
V (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?   
p794
tp795
a(V RAY 
p796
V Yeah.  
p797
tp798
a(V KRAMER 
p799
V (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)    
p800
tp801
a(V RAY 
p802
V Hey, hey, are you a cop?  
p803
tp804
a(V KRAMER 
p805
V Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?   
p806
tp807
a(V RAY 
p808
V Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.   
p809
tp810
a(V KRAMER 
p811
V Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)    (Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)   (Kramer guides Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment)    
p812
tp813
a(V JERRY 
p814
V Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?    (Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue)   
p815
tp816
a(V GEORGE 
p817
V Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!   
p818
tp819
a(V KRAMER 
p820
V Yeah.  
p821
tp822
a(V JERRY 
p823
V Kramer, what did you do?  
p824
tp825
a(V KRAMER 
p826
V Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.   
p827
tp828
a(V GEORGE 
p829
V I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!   
p830
tp831
a(V KRAMER 
p832
V Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground)    (Scene ends) (Night club)  
p833
tp834
a.
