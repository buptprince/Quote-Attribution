V  THE PONY REMARK  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Night club)   My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know    how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white    shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring.    It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the    glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to    hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's pick it up right there."    (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's parents are in town. His father's watching T.V., his mother is ironing his father's jackets)

a(V HELEN 
p4
V (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He doesn't respond) What's    wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!    (Phone rings)  
p5
tp6
a(V MORTY 
p7
V Are you getting that?  
p8
tp9
a(V HELEN 
p10
V I thought you were getting it.  
p11
tp12
a(V MORTY 
p13
V Should I pick up?  
p14
tp15
a(V HELEN 
p16
V You want me to get that?  
p17
tp18
a(V MORTY 
p19
V I'll get it!  
p20
tp21
a(V HELEN 
p22
V I'll get it!   (They both go for the phone, Helen gets to it first)  
p23
tp24
a(V HELEN 
p25
V Hello?.. Hello?   (She hangs up. Jerry enters - he's wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove)   
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)   
p29
tp30
a(V MORTY 
p31
V So, how'd you do?  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship     game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.   
p35
tp36
a(V HELEN 
p37
V This is your greatest moment? A game?    
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.    
p41
tp42
a(V MORTY 
p43
V You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.    
p44
tp45
a(V HELEN 
p46
V Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?   
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.   
p50
tp51
a(V HELEN 
p52
V But it's their 50th anniversary.  
p53
tp54
a(V MORTY 
p55
V You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.   
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V First of all, I made plans with Elaine.    
p59
tp60
a(V HELEN 
p61
V So bring her.  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.   
p65
tp66
a(V MORTY 
p67
V I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.   
p68
tp69
a(V HELEN 
p70
V At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.    
p71
tp72
a(V MORTY 
p73
V How come he gets to leave?  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the    middle of his conversation.  
p77
tp78
a(V MORTY 
p79
V And it's always about Jeffrey, right?    
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.    (Enter Kramer)  
p83
tp84
a(V KRAMER 
p85
V Morty, are you coming in?  
p86
tp87
a(V MORTY 
p88
V Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.  
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..    
p95
tp96
a(V KRAMER 
p97
V Yeah!  
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?    
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.    
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V What are you doing?  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V Levels.  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V Levels?  
p113
tp114
a(V KRAMER 
p115
V Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You    know, like ancient Egypt.  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V You drew up plans for this?  
p119
tp120
a(V KRAMER 
p121
V No, no. It's all in my head.  
p122
tp123
a(V MORTY 
p124
V I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.   
p125
tp126
a(V KRAMER 
p127
V Oh, I'll be comfortable.  
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V When do you intend to do this?  
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.   
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V You're doing this yourself?  
p137
tp138
a(V KRAMER 
p139
V It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?   
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.   
p143
tp144
a(V KRAMER 
p145
V Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.   
p146
tp147
a(V MORTY 
p148
V Hey, that's some big job.  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V I don't see it happening.  
p152
tp153
a(V KRAMER 
p154
V Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.   
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Seriously?  
p158
tp159
a(V HELEN 
p160
V I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.   
p161
tp162
a(V KRAMER 
p163
V A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.   
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V I'll give you a year.  
p167
tp168
a(V KRAMER 
p169
V No, no, no. End of the month.  
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V It's a bet. (They both "pinkie swear" to lock the deal)    (Scene ends)   (Manya's apartment)   (Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Leo grabs his choulder)    
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?    
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V No, no. I'm fine.  
p179
tp180
a(V LEO 
p181
V Jerry, are you listening to this?  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Yeah, Uncle Leo.  
p185
tp186
a(V LEO 
p187
V So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.    
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V Right. For reducing the pond scum?    
p191
tp192
a(V LEO 
p193
V No, for the walking tours.  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.   
p197
tp198
a(V LEO 
p199
V That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever     he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?   
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Mickey Mantle?  
p203
tp204
a(V ELAINE 
p205
V (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!    
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.   
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V Mmm.. phenomenal peas..  
p212
tp213
a(V MORTY 
p214
V Are you ready for dessert?  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.   
p218
tp219
a(V MANYA 
p220
V (Surprised) You're going?  
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.    
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.   
p227
tp228
a(V MANYA 
p229
V Can't dance?  
p230
tp231
a(V HELEN 
p232
V He's kidding, Manya.  
p233
tp234
a(V MANYA 
p235
V Is that a joke?  
p236
tp237
a(V HELEN 
p238
V (Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?   
p239
tp240
a(V MANYA 
p241
V Yeah, yeah..  
p242
tp243
a(V HELEN 
p244
V I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.    
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Horses. They're like big riding dogs.    
p248
tp249
a(V ELAINE 
p250
V What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..   
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.   
p254
tp255
a(V MANYA 
p256
V ..I had a pony.   (The room is dead quiet)  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.   
p260
tp261
a(V MANYA 
p262
V (Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?   
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..   
p266
tp267
a(V HELEN 
p268
V Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?   
p269
tp270
a(V MANYA 
p271
V He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.   
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?   
p275
tp276
a(V MANYA 
p277
V You! You said so!  
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..   
p281
tp282
a(V MANYA 
p283
V That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)   
p284
tp285
a(V ISAAC 
p286
V Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.    (Isaac leaves, everyone looks at Jerry)  
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on    that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come    hre if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.. am I wrong?     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Morty and Helen are leaving, their bags are packed)  
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V I'll drive you to the airport.  
p293
tp294
a(V HELEN 
p295
V No, we're taking a cab.  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.   
p299
tp300
a(V HELEN 
p301
V Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.    
p302
tp303
a(V MORTY 
p304
V Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.   
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.   
p308
tp309
a(V HELEN 
p310
V You know, you should give Manya a call.    
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Maybe I will.   (Jerry opens his door, Kramer's standing in the hallway)  
p314
tp315
a(V KRAMER 
p316
V Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) ..Need any help with those?   
p317
tp318
a(V MORTY 
p319
V It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?   
p320
tp321
a(V KRAMER 
p322
V Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.   
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.    
p326
tp327
a(V HELEN 
p328
V Goodbye, Jerry.  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Take care.  
p332
tp333
a(V HELEN 
p334
V We'll call you. (Leaves)  
p335
tp336
a(V MORTY 
p337
V Bye, Jer.  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Bye, Dad. Take it easy.  
p341
tp342
a(V MORTY 
p343
V Bye, Mr. Kramer.  
p344
tp345
a(V KRAMER 
p346
V Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)    
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V So, when do I get my dinner?  
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.   
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.   
p356
tp357
a(V KRAMER 
p358
V There's not bet if I' not doing it.    
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V That's the bet! That you're not doing it!   
p362
tp363
a(V KRAMER 
p364
V Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.   
p368
tp369
a(V KRAMER 
p370
V And it could be done.  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.   
p374
tp375
a(V KRAMER 
p376
V But I don't want the levels!  
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. (Jerry    goes over to the window, and opens it. He yells out of it) Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)  
p380
tp381
a(V HELEN 
p382
V Who did you talk to?  
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Uncle Leo.  
p386
tp387
a(V HELEN 
p388
V And when's the funeral?  
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V I don't know. He said he'd call back.    
p392
tp393
a(V MORTY 
p394
V You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.   
p395
tp396
a(V HELEN 
p397
V She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..   
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V What?  
p401
tp402
a(V HELEN 
p403
V What? Nothing.  
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V You don't think.. What? The pony remark?    
p407
tp408
a(V HELEN 
p409
V Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.   
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V You don't think that I killed her?    
p413
tp414
a(V MORTY 
p415
V You know what the flight back'll cost us?   
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!   
p419
tp420
a(V MORTY 
p421
V Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.    
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.    (Helen picks it up)  
p425
tp426
a(V HELEN 
p427
V Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday.   
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?  
p431
tp432
a(V HELEN 
p433
V Two o' clock, Wednesday. (Jerry shrugs) What?   
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.   
p437
tp438
a(V HELEN 
p439
V So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.   
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V I didn't even know the woman.  
p443
tp444
a(V HELEN 
p445
V So don't go.  
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.   
p449
tp450
a(V HELEN 
p451
V Jery, no one's forcing you.  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.    
p455
tp456
a(V HELEN 
p457
V I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't have anything.    
p458
tp459
a(V MORTY 
p460
V I got a sport jacket.  
p461
tp462
a(V HELEN 
p463
V You're not wearing that to a funeral.    
p464
tp465
a(V MORTY 
p466
V What's wrong with it?  
p467
tp468
a(V HELEN 
p469
V It looks ridiculous.  
p470
tp471
a(V MORTY 
p472
V What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?    
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V I don't know what to do.  
p476
tp477
a(V MORTY 
p478
V ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!    (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and    get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a    meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.    (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)

a(V ELAINE 
p484
V I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?   
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V Two Forty-Five.  
p488
tp489
a(V ELAINE 
p490
V And what time's the funeral?  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V Two o' clock.  
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V How long does a funeral take?  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.   
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V So you cna't do both?  
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would    understand.  
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V How can you even consider not going?    
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I     just don't see how it could occur.  
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.   
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.   
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V I know, and then you say to yourself, "From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it." But then you go, "How? What can I do that's not     wasting it?"  
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?   
p524
tp525
a(V GEORGE 
p526
V You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.   
p527
tp528
a(V ELAINE 
p529
V He has to go. He may have killed her.    
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.   
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.   
p536
tp537
a(V GEORGE 
p538
V (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?   
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V Bender.  
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the     funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, "I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."   
p545
tp546
a(V ELAINE 
p547
V Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?   
p548
tp549
a(V GEORGE 
p550
V If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang     around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?  
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.    
p554
tp555
a(V GEORGE 
p556
V You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.    
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.   
p560
tp561
a(V ELAINE 
p562
V Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?    
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.   
p566
tp567
a(V ELAINE 
p568
V Three hundred a month? Oh my God.   (Scene ends)   (Funeral home)   (The eulogy is in progress. Jerry attended afterall)  
p569
tp570
a(V MAN 
p571
V Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler    world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. (Jerry throws his hands up) Oh, how she loved that    pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. (Jery    sinks in his seat)   (Scene ends)   (Anteroom of funeral parlor)  
p572

a(V JERRY 
p574
V (Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about now.   
p575
tp576
a(V HELEN 
p577
V It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.    (Scene cuts to Morty talking to an intern)  
p578
tp579
a(V INTERN 
p580
V I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.   
p581
tp582
a(V MORTY 
p583
V You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.    (Scene cuts back to Jerry)  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..   
p587
tp588
a(V LEO 
p589
V (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that    operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.    (Scene cuts back to Morty)  
p590
tp591
a(V MORTY 
p592
V You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.   
p593

a(V JERRY

V (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.    
p596
tp597
a(V ELAINE 
p598
V Oh, me too.  
p599
tp600
a(V ISAAC 
p601
V Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.   
p602
tp603
a(V ELAINE 
p604
V So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?     (Jerry shake his head and walks away)  
p605
tp606
a(V ISAAC 
p607
V Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.   
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?    
p611
tp612
a(V ISAAC 
p613
V Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.   
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?   
p617
tp618
a(V ISAAC 
p619
V Although they say it's a dry heat.    
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?   
p623
tp624
a(V ISAAC 
p625
V I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.   
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.     (Jerry comes back)  
p629
tp630
a(V ISAAC 
p631
V Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.   
p632

p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V (To Elaine) You know Jeffery?  
p638
tp639
a(V ELAINE 
p640
V Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.    (Helen approaches Jerry)  
p641
tp642
a(V HELEN 
p643
V It's raining.  
p644
tp645
a(V JERRY 
p646
V (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.    (Scene cuts back to Morty)  
p647
tp648
a(V MORTY 
p649
V Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.   
p650
tp651
a(V INTERN 
p652
V I can't. I'll get in trouble.  
p653
tp654
a(V MORTY

V Oh, for God's sakes!   (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)

a(V GEORGE 
p658
V Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.   
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V It's never happend to me before.  
p662
tp663
a(V ELAINE 
p664
V I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far off the base?"   
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.   
p668
tp669
a(V GEORGE 
p670
V And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?   
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V I thought there were two outs.  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.   
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V It was the single worst moment of my life.   
p680
tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V What about Sharon Besser?  
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V Oh, well, of course. 1973.  
p686
tp687
a(V ELAINE 
p688
V Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?    
p689
tp690
a(V JERRY 
p691
V Wonder about what?  
p692
tp693
a(V ELAINE 
p694
V You know.. the spirit world.  
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?   
p698
tp699
a(V ELAINE 
p700
V I never saw anyone play like that.    
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V But I went ot the funeral.  
p704
tp705
a(V ELAINE 
p706
V Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.   
p707
tp708
a(V GEORGE 
p709
V Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.   
p710
tp711
a(V JERRY 
p712
V Don't you think she would've heard I was there?   
p713
tp714
a(V GEORGE 
p715
V Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs)
