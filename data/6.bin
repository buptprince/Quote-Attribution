aV  THE PONY REMARK  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Night club)   My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know    how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white    shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring.    It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the    glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to    hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's pick it up right there."    (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's parents are in town. His father's watching T.V., his mother is ironing his father's jackets)

V HELEN 
p5
aV (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He doesn't respond) What's    wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!    (Phone rings)  
p6
aa(lp7
V MORTY 
p8
aV Are you getting that?  
p9
aa(lp10
V HELEN 
p11
aV I thought you were getting it.  
p12
aa(lp13
V MORTY 
p14
aV Should I pick up?  
p15
aa(lp16
V HELEN 
p17
aV You want me to get that?  
p18
aa(lp19
V MORTY 
p20
aV I'll get it!  
p21
aa(lp22
V HELEN 
p23
aV I'll get it!   (They both go for the phone, Helen gets to it first)  
p24
aa(lp25
V HELEN 
p26
aV Hello?.. Hello?   (She hangs up. Jerry enters - he's wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove)   
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)   
p30
aa(lp31
V MORTY 
p32
aV So, how'd you do?  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship     game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.   
p36
aa(lp37
V HELEN 
p38
aV This is your greatest moment? A game?    
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.    
p42
aa(lp43
V MORTY 
p44
aV You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.    
p45
aa(lp46
V HELEN 
p47
aV Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?   
p48
aa(lp49
V JERRY 
p50
aV Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.   
p51
aa(lp52
V HELEN 
p53
aV But it's their 50th anniversary.  
p54
aa(lp55
V MORTY 
p56
aV You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.   
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY 
p59
aV First of all, I made plans with Elaine.    
p60
aa(lp61
V HELEN 
p62
aV So bring her.  
p63
aa(lp64
V JERRY 
p65
aV I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.   
p66
aa(lp67
V MORTY 
p68
aV I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.   
p69
aa(lp70
V HELEN 
p71
aV At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.    
p72
aa(lp73
V MORTY 
p74
aV How come he gets to leave?  
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the    middle of his conversation.  
p78
aa(lp79
V MORTY 
p80
aV And it's always about Jeffrey, right?    
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.    (Enter Kramer)  
p84
aa(lp85
V KRAMER 
p86
aV Morty, are you coming in?  
p87
aa(lp88
V MORTY 
p89
aV Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.  
p90
aa(lp91
V KRAMER 
p92
aV (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?  
p93
aa(lp94
V JERRY 
p95
aV We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..    
p96
aa(lp97
V KRAMER 
p98
aV Yeah!  
p99
aa(lp100
V JERRY 
p101
aV (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?    
p102
aa(lp103
V KRAMER 
p104
aV I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.    
p105
aa(lp106
V JERRY 
p107
aV What are you doing?  
p108
aa(lp109
V KRAMER 
p110
aV Levels.  
p111
aa(lp112
V JERRY 
p113
aV Levels?  
p114
aa(lp115
V KRAMER 
p116
aV Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You    know, like ancient Egypt.  
p117
aa(lp118
V JERRY 
p119
aV You drew up plans for this?  
p120
aa(lp121
V KRAMER 
p122
aV No, no. It's all in my head.  
p123
aa(lp124
V MORTY 
p125
aV I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.   
p126
aa(lp127
V KRAMER 
p128
aV Oh, I'll be comfortable.  
p129
aa(lp130
V JERRY 
p131
aV When do you intend to do this?  
p132
aa(lp133
V KRAMER 
p134
aV Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.   
p135
aa(lp136
V JERRY 
p137
aV You're doing this yourself?  
p138
aa(lp139
V KRAMER 
p140
aV It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?   
p141
aa(lp142
V JERRY 
p143
aV Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.   
p144
aa(lp145
V KRAMER 
p146
aV Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.   
p147
aa(lp148
V MORTY 
p149
aV Hey, that's some big job.  
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV I don't see it happening.  
p153
aa(lp154
V KRAMER 
p155
aV Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.   
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV Seriously?  
p159
aa(lp160
V HELEN 
p161
aV I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.   
p162
aa(lp163
V KRAMER 
p164
aV A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.   
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV I'll give you a year.  
p168
aa(lp169
V KRAMER 
p170
aV No, no, no. End of the month.  
p171
aa(lp172
V JERRY 
p173
aV It's a bet. (They both "pinkie swear" to lock the deal)    (Scene ends)   (Manya's apartment)   (Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Leo grabs his choulder)    
p174
aa(lp175
V JERRY 
p176
aV Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?    
p177
aa(lp178
V ELAINE 
p179
aV No, no. I'm fine.  
p180
aa(lp181
V LEO 
p182
aV Jerry, are you listening to this?  
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV Yeah, Uncle Leo.  
p186
aa(lp187
V LEO 
p188
aV So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.    
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV Right. For reducing the pond scum?    
p192
aa(lp193
V LEO 
p194
aV No, for the walking tours.  
p195
aa(lp196
V JERRY 
p197
aV Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.   
p198
aa(lp199
V LEO 
p200
aV That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever     he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?   
p201
aa(lp202
V JERRY 
p203
aV Mickey Mantle?  
p204
aa(lp205
V ELAINE 
p206
aV (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!    
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.   
p210
aa(lp211
V ELAINE 
p212
aV Mmm.. phenomenal peas..  
p213
aa(lp214
V MORTY 
p215
aV Are you ready for dessert?  
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.   
p219
aa(lp220
V MANYA 
p221
aV (Surprised) You're going?  
p222
aa(lp223
V ELAINE 
p224
aV I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.    
p225
aa(lp226
V JERRY 
p227
aV Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.   
p228
aa(lp229
V MANYA 
p230
aV Can't dance?  
p231
aa(lp232
V HELEN 
p233
aV He's kidding, Manya.  
p234
aa(lp235
V MANYA 
p236
aV Is that a joke?  
p237
aa(lp238
V HELEN 
p239
aV (Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?   
p240
aa(lp241
V MANYA 
p242
aV Yeah, yeah..  
p243
aa(lp244
V HELEN 
p245
aV I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.    
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV Horses. They're like big riding dogs.    
p249
aa(lp250
V ELAINE 
p251
aV What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..   
p252
aa(lp253
V JERRY 
p254
aV I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.   
p255
aa(lp256
V MANYA 
p257
aV ..I had a pony.   (The room is dead quiet)  
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.   
p261
aa(lp262
V MANYA 
p263
aV (Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?   
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY 
p266
aV Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..   
p267
aa(lp268
V HELEN 
p269
aV Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?   
p270
aa(lp271
V MANYA 
p272
aV He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.   
p273
aa(lp274
V JERRY 
p275
aV Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?   
p276
aa(lp277
V MANYA 
p278
aV You! You said so!  
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..   
p282
aa(lp283
V MANYA 
p284
aV That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)   
p285
aa(lp286
V ISAAC 
p287
aV Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.    (Isaac leaves, everyone looks at Jerry)  
p288
aa(lp289
V JERRY 
p290
aV I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on    that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come    hre if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.. am I wrong?     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Morty and Helen are leaving, their bags are packed)  
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV I'll drive you to the airport.  
p294
aa(lp295
V HELEN 
p296
aV No, we're taking a cab.  
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.   
p300
aa(lp301
V HELEN 
p302
aV Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.    
p303
aa(lp304
V MORTY 
p305
aV Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.   
p306
aa(lp307
V JERRY 
p308
aV Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.   
p309
aa(lp310
V HELEN 
p311
aV You know, you should give Manya a call.    
p312
aa(lp313
V JERRY 
p314
aV Maybe I will.   (Jerry opens his door, Kramer's standing in the hallway)  
p315
aa(lp316
V KRAMER 
p317
aV Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) ..Need any help with those?   
p318
aa(lp319
V MORTY 
p320
aV It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?   
p321
aa(lp322
V KRAMER 
p323
aV Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.   
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.    
p327
aa(lp328
V HELEN 
p329
aV Goodbye, Jerry.  
p330
aa(lp331
V JERRY 
p332
aV Take care.  
p333
aa(lp334
V HELEN 
p335
aV We'll call you. (Leaves)  
p336
aa(lp337
V MORTY 
p338
aV Bye, Jer.  
p339
aa(lp340
V JERRY 
p341
aV Bye, Dad. Take it easy.  
p342
aa(lp343
V MORTY 
p344
aV Bye, Mr. Kramer.  
p345
aa(lp346
V KRAMER 
p347
aV Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)    
p348
aa(lp349
V JERRY 
p350
aV So, when do I get my dinner?  
p351
aa(lp352
V KRAMER 
p353
aV There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.   
p354
aa(lp355
V JERRY 
p356
aV Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.   
p357
aa(lp358
V KRAMER 
p359
aV There's not bet if I' not doing it.    
p360
aa(lp361
V JERRY 
p362
aV That's the bet! That you're not doing it!   
p363
aa(lp364
V KRAMER 
p365
aV Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.   
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY 
p368
aV We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.   
p369
aa(lp370
V KRAMER 
p371
aV And it could be done.  
p372
aa(lp373
V JERRY 
p374
aV Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.   
p375
aa(lp376
V KRAMER 
p377
aV But I don't want the levels!  
p378
aa(lp379
V JERRY 
p380
aV That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. (Jerry    goes over to the window, and opens it. He yells out of it) Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)  
p381
aa(lp382
V HELEN 
p383
aV Who did you talk to?  
p384
aa(lp385
V JERRY 
p386
aV Uncle Leo.  
p387
aa(lp388
V HELEN 
p389
aV And when's the funeral?  
p390
aa(lp391
V JERRY 
p392
aV I don't know. He said he'd call back.    
p393
aa(lp394
V MORTY 
p395
aV You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.   
p396
aa(lp397
V HELEN 
p398
aV She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..   
p399
aa(lp400
V JERRY 
p401
aV What?  
p402
aa(lp403
V HELEN 
p404
aV What? Nothing.  
p405
aa(lp406
V JERRY 
p407
aV You don't think.. What? The pony remark?    
p408
aa(lp409
V HELEN 
p410
aV Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.   
p411
aa(lp412
V JERRY 
p413
aV You don't think that I killed her?    
p414
aa(lp415
V MORTY 
p416
aV You know what the flight back'll cost us?   
p417
aa(lp418
V JERRY 
p419
aV It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!   
p420
aa(lp421
V MORTY 
p422
aV Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.    
p423
aa(lp424
V JERRY 
p425
aV The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.    (Helen picks it up)  
p426
aa(lp427
V HELEN 
p428
aV Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday.   
p429
aa(lp430
V JERRY 
p431
aV Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?  
p432
aa(lp433
V HELEN 
p434
aV Two o' clock, Wednesday. (Jerry shrugs) What?   
p435
aa(lp436
V JERRY 
p437
aV I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.   
p438
aa(lp439
V HELEN 
p440
aV So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.   
p441
aa(lp442
V JERRY 
p443
aV I didn't even know the woman.  
p444
aa(lp445
V HELEN 
p446
aV So don't go.  
p447
aa(lp448
V JERRY 
p449
aV I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.   
p450
aa(lp451
V HELEN 
p452
aV Jery, no one's forcing you.  
p453
aa(lp454
V JERRY 
p455
aV I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.    
p456
aa(lp457
V HELEN 
p458
aV I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't have anything.    
p459
aa(lp460
V MORTY 
p461
aV I got a sport jacket.  
p462
aa(lp463
V HELEN 
p464
aV You're not wearing that to a funeral.    
p465
aa(lp466
V MORTY 
p467
aV What's wrong with it?  
p468
aa(lp469
V HELEN 
p470
aV It looks ridiculous.  
p471
aa(lp472
V MORTY 
p473
aV What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?    
p474
aa(lp475
V JERRY 
p476
aV I don't know what to do.  
p477
aa(lp478
V MORTY 
p479

p482
aV We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and    get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a    meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.    (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)

aV I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?   
p486
aa(lp487
V JERRY 
p488
aV Two Forty-Five.  
p489
aa(lp490
V ELAINE 
p491
aV And what time's the funeral?  
p492
aa(lp493
V JERRY 
p494
aV Two o' clock.  
p495
aa(lp496
V ELAINE 
p497
aV How long does a funeral take?  
p498
aa(lp499
V JERRY 
p500
aV Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.   
p501
aa(lp502
V ELAINE 
p503
aV So you cna't do both?  
p504
aa(lp505
V JERRY 
p506
aV You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would    understand.  
p507
aa(lp508
V ELAINE 
p509
aV How can you even consider not going?    
p510
aa(lp511
V GEORGE 
p512
aV You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I     just don't see how it could occur.  
p513
aa(lp514
V ELAINE 
p515
aV You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.   
p516
aa(lp517
V GEORGE 
p518
aV They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.   
p519
aa(lp520
V JERRY 
p521
aV I know, and then you say to yourself, "From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it." But then you go, "How? What can I do that's not     wasting it?"  
p522
aa(lp523
V ELAINE 
p524
aV Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?   
p525
aa(lp526
V GEORGE 
p527
aV You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.   
p528
aa(lp529
V ELAINE 
p530
aV He has to go. He may have killed her.    
p531
aa(lp532
V JERRY 
p533
aV Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.   
p534
aa(lp535
V ELAINE 
p536
aV Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.   
p537

V GEORGE 
p539
aV (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?   
p540
aa(lp541
V JERRY 
p542
aV Bender.  
p543
aa(lp544
V GEORGE 
p545
aV Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the     funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, "I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."   
p546
aa(lp547
V ELAINE 
p548
aV Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?   
p549
aa(lp550
V GEORGE 
p551
aV If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang     around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?  
p552
aa(lp553
V ELAINE 
p554
aV George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.    
p555
aa(lp556
V GEORGE 
p557
aV You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.    
p558
aa(lp559
V JERRY 
p560
aV Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.   
p561
aa(lp562
V ELAINE 
p563
aV Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?    
p564
aa(lp565
V JERRY 
p566
aV I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.   
p567
aa(lp568
V ELAINE 
p569
aV Three hundred a month? Oh my God.   (Scene ends)   (Funeral home)   (The eulogy is in progress. Jerry attended afterall)

V MAN 
p572
aV Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler    world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. (Jerry throws his hands up) Oh, how she loved that    pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. (Jery    sinks in his seat)   (Scene ends)   (Anteroom of funeral parlor)

aV It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.    (Scene cuts to Morty talking to an intern)

V INTERN 
p581
aV I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.   
p582
aa(lp583
V MORTY 
p584
aV You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.    (Scene cuts back to Jerry)  
p585
aa(lp586
V JERRY 
p587
aV (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..   
p588
aa(lp589
V LEO 
p590
aV (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that    operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.    (Scene cuts back to Morty)  
p591
aa(lp592
V MORTY 
p593
aV You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.

p596
aV (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.

V ELAINE 
p599
aV Oh, me too.  
p600
aa(lp601
V ISAAC 
p602
aV Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.   
p603
aa(lp604
V ELAINE 
p605
aV So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?     (Jerry shake his head and walks away)  
p606
aa(lp607
V ISAAC 
p608
aV Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.   
p609
aa(lp610
V ELAINE 
p611
aV Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?    
p612
aa(lp613
V ISAAC 
p614
aV Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.   
p615
aa(lp616
V ELAINE 
p617
aV Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?   
p618
aa(lp619
V ISAAC 
p620
aV Although they say it's a dry heat.    
p621
aa(lp622
V ELAINE 
p623
aV Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?   
p624
aa(lp625
V ISAAC 
p626
aV I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.   
p627
aa(lp628
V ELAINE 
p629
aV I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.     (Jerry comes back)  
p630
aa(lp631
V ISAAC 
p632
aV Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.

V JERRY 
p638
aV (To Elaine) You know Jeffery?  
p639
aa(lp640
V ELAINE 
p641
aV Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.    (Helen approaches Jerry)  
p642
aa(lp643
V HELEN 
p644
aV It's raining.  
p645
aa(lp646
V JERRY 
p647
aV (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.    (Scene cuts back to Morty)  
p648
aa(lp649
V MORTY 
p650
aV Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.   
p651
aa(lp652
V INTERN 
p653
aV I can't. I'll get in trouble.  
p654

aV Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.   
p660
aa(lp661
V JERRY 
p662
aV It's never happend to me before.  
p663
aa(lp664
V ELAINE 
p665
aV I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far off the base?"   
p666
aa(lp667
V JERRY 
p668
aV I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.   
p669
aa(lp670
V GEORGE 
p671
aV And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?   
p672
aa(lp673
V JERRY 
p674
aV I thought there were two outs.  
p675
aa(lp676
V ELAINE 
p677
aV I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.   
p678
aa(lp679
V JERRY 
p680
aV It was the single worst moment of my life.   
p681
aa(lp682
V GEORGE 
p683
aV What about Sharon Besser?  
p684
aa(lp685
V JERRY 
p686
aV Oh, well, of course. 1973.  
p687
aa(lp688
V ELAINE 
p689
aV Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?    
p690
aa(lp691
V JERRY 
p692
aV Wonder about what?  
p693
aa(lp694
V ELAINE 
p695
aV You know.. the spirit world.  
p696
aa(lp697
V JERRY 
p698
aV You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?   
p699
aa(lp700
V ELAINE 
p701
aV I never saw anyone play like that.    
p702
aa(lp703
V JERRY 
p704
aV But I went ot the funeral.  
p705
aa(lp706
V ELAINE 
p707
aV Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.   
p708
aa(lp709
V GEORGE 
p710
aV Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.   
p711
aa(lp712
V JERRY 
p713
aV Don't you think she would've heard I was there?   
p714
