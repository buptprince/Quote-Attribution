aV  MALE UNBONDING  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   Most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on    something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies.    Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, "Honey, I think Jim's working on something over    there." So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men    want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, "What are you using, the Philips head?" You know,    we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. They cut those    little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. Right over there. "What are you using the    steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold."   (Jerry's apartment building)   (Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator)

p5
aV I had to say something. I had to say something. Everything was going so well; I had to say something.   
p6
aa(lp7
V JERRY 
p8
aV I don't think you did anything wrong.    
p9
aa(lp10
V GEORGE 
p11
aV I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you.   
p12
aa(lp13
V JERRY 
p14
aV We can only thank God for that.   (Elevator opens, they get on)  
p15
aa(lp16
V GEORGE 
p17
aV I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It's only a matter of time now.   
p18
aa(lp19
V JERRY 
p20
aV You're imagining this. Really.  
p21
aa(lp22
V GEORGE 
p23
aV Oh no. No, no, no, no.   (elevator doors close)  
p24
aa(lp25
V GEORGE 
p26
aV I'll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.    
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV What floss? When?  
p30
aa(lp31
V GEORGE 
p32
aV We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my    pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.   
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV Ah, mint.  
p36
aa(lp37
V GEORGE 
p38
aV Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I look up, I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..    (eleveator doors open, they get off)  
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV So let me get this straight: she saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.   
p42
aa(lp43
V GEORGE 
p44
aV If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.   
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?    
p48
aa(lp49
V GEORGE 
p50
aV Yes, I am.  
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV (looks at a carrying pouch George is wearing) You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?   
p54
aa(lp55
V GEORGE 
p56
aV What? You don't like this?  
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY 
p59
aV It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.    (they go into Jerry's apartment to find Kramer talking on the phone)   
p60
aa(lp61
V KRAMER 
p62
aV Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,     yeah, take my number - 555-8643. Okay, here he is. (hands phone to Jerry.)   
p63
aa(lp64
V JERRY 
p65
aV (to Kramer) Who is it?  
p66
aa(lp67
V KRAMER 
p68
aV Take it.  
p69
aa(lp70
V JERRY 
p71
aV Who is it?  
p72
aa(lp73
V KRAMER 
p74
aV It's for you.  
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. I was out of town. I just got back.. Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just    my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy    right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. thanks.. bye. (hangs up, then addresses Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I    hate just being handed a phone.  
p78
aa(lp79
V KRAMER 
p80
aV Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you   
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.    
p84
aa(lp85
V KRAMER 
p86
aV Well, why not?  
p87
aa(lp88
V JERRY 
p89
aV He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.   
p90
aa(lp91
V GEORGE 
p92
aV What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We're not    going?  
p93
aa(lp94
V JERRY 
p95
aV We're going. That's next Wednesday.    
p96
aa(lp97
V GEORGE 
p98
aV Oh. Who is this guy?  
p99
aa(lp100
V JERRY 
p101
aV His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of     my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so self-involved.    (phone rings, Kramer pulls his phone out of his pocket)  
p102
aa(lp103
V KRAMER 
p104
aV That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica Industries.. Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own     pie.  
p105
aa(lp106
V JERRY 
p107
aV Can you conduct your business elsewhere?    
p108
aa(lp109
V KRAMER 
p110
aV (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while still on the phone.)   
p111
aa(lp112
V GEORGE 
p113
aV I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.    
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit     there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.    
p117
aa(lp118
V GEORGE 
p119
aV I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.   
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him "I Don't think we're right for each other.." He's a guy. At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,     the relationship goes sour, you end it.  
p123
aa(lp124
V GEORGE 
p125
aV No, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.   
p126
aa(lp127
V JERRY 
p128
aV Just break up with him?  
p129
aa(lp130
V GEORGE 
p131
aV Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.     (scene ends)   (Nightclub)  
p132
aa(lp133
V JERRY 
p134
aV As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, "Bill, I feel I need to see other men." Do     you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See,    the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost    all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever    say is "So, what's in the refrigerator?"   (Coffee Shop)   (Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table)  
p135
aa(lp136
V JOEL 
p137
aV ..so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo.    
p138
aa(lp139
V JERRY 
p140
aV You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-   
p141
aa(lp142
V JOEL 
p143
aV (interrupting) Hey, hey, hey, hey we're starving here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already!   
p144
aa(lp145
V JERRY 
p146
aV (testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going to Iran this summer.   
p147
aa(lp148
V JOEL 
p149
aV I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic.    
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it is Farsi.   
p153
aa(lp154
V JOEL 
p155
aV Do you think I need a haircut?   (waitress comes to their table)  
p156
aa(lp157
V WAITRESS 
p158
aV Are you ready?  
p159
aa(lp160
V JERRY 
p161
aV Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.   
p162
aa(lp163
V JOEL 
p164
aV Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't want that processed turkey. I hate it.    
p165
aa(lp166
V WAITRESS 
p167
aV I think it's real turkey.  
p168
aa(lp169
V JOEL 
p170
aV Is there a real bird in the back?  
p171
aa(lp172
V WAITRESS 
p173
aV No, there's not bird but-  
p174
aa(lp175
V JOEL 
p176
aV Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay?     (waitress leaves)  
p177
aa(lp178
V JOEL 
p179
aV (cont.) Unbelievable..  
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV How can you talk to someone like that?    
p183
aa(lp184
V JOEL 
p185
aV What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?   
p186
aa(lp187
V JERRY 
p188
aV Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you.   
p189
aa(lp190
V JOEL 
p191
aV Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into.    
p192
aa(lp193
V JERRY AND JOEL 
p194
aV Howard metro.  
p195
aa(lp196
V JOEL 
p197
aV He asked me if I still saw you. I said, "Sure, I see him all the time. We're great friends." Anyway, Howard says hello.   
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see each other anymore.   
p201
aa(lp202
V JOEL 
p203
aV what?  
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY

aV This friendship.. it's not working.    
p207
aa(lp208
V JOEL 
p209
aV Not working? What are you talking about?    
p210
aa(lp211
V JERRY 
p212
aV We're just not suited to be friends.    
p213
aa(lp214
V JOEL 
p215
aV How can you say that?  
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we don't have anything in common.    
p219
aa(lp220
V JOEL 
p221
aV (starting to cry) Wait. Wat did I do? Tell me.. I want to know.   
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's me. It's.. this is very difficult.    
p225
aa(lp226
V JOEL 
p227
aV Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you're a very busy guy.    
p228
aa(lp229
V JERRY 
p230
aV No, it's not that.  
p231
aa(lp232
V JOEL 
p233
aV (crying) You're one of the few people I can talk to.   
p234
aa(lp235
V JERRY 
p236
aV Oh, come on. That's not true.  
p237
aa(lp238
V JOEL 
p239
aV I always tell everybody about you; tell everybody to go see your show. I mean, I'm your biggest fan!

aV I mean, you're my best friend.  
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.   
p249
aa(lp250
V JOEL 
p251
aV I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't believe it.   
p252
aa(lp253
V JERRY 
p254
aV Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't mean it.   
p255
aa(lp256
V JOEL 
p257
aV Didn't mean what?  
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.   
p261
aa(lp262
V JOEL 
p263
aV Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.    
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY

V JOEL 
p287
aV Where is that waitress?! Hey! ..   (scene ends)   (Bank)   (Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip; George is carrying a jug full of pennies.)   
p288
aa(lp289
V GEORGE 
p290
aV ..she calls me up at my office, she says, "We have to talk."   
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV Uh, the four worst words in the English language.   
p294
aa(lp295
V GEORGE 
p296
aV That, or "Who's bra is this?"  
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV That is worse.  
p300
aa(lp301
V GEORGE 
p302
aV So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's "not working".   
p303
aa(lp304
V JERRY 
p305
aV Really.  
p306
aa(lp307
V GEORGE 
p308
aV So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or    do I eat?  
p309
aa(lp310
V JERRY 
p311
aV Hm? You ate.  
p312
aa(lp313
V GEORGE 
p314
aV We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.    
p315
aa(lp316
V JERRY 
p317
aV Someone says, "Get out of my life!" and that doesn't affect your appetite?    
p318
aa(lp319
V GEORGE 
p320
aV Have you ever had their egg salad?    
p321
aa(lp322
V JERRY 
p323
aV It is unbelievable.  
p324
aa(lp325
V GEORGE 
p326
aV It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off     with a sandwich.  
p327
aa(lp328
V JERRY 
p329
aV (looking at George's penny jug) How much could you possibly have in there? GEORGE: It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I    know guy who took his vacation on change.  
p330
aa(lp331
V JERRY 
p332
aV Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?    
p333
aa(lp334
V GEORGE 
p335
aV (sarcastic) That's funny. You're a funny guy.   
p336
aa(lp337

aV Geez.  
p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY 
p353
aV Oh, God.  
p354
aa(lp355
V GEORGE 
p356
aV I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.   
p357
aa(lp358
V JERRY 
p359
aV Listen, George, little problem with the game.   
p360
aa(lp361
V GEORGE

aV The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..

p374
aV You what?!  
p375
aa(lp376
V JERRY 
p377
aV Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.   
p378
aa(lp379
V GEORGE 
p380
aV No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?   
p381
aa(lp382

p383
aV (talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.   
p384
aa(lp385

p386
aV Why did you give him my ticket for?    
p387
aa(lp388

p389
aV You didn't see him. It was horrible.    
p390
aa(lp391
V GOERGE 
p392
aV Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.    
p393
aa(lp394
V JERRY 
p395
aV I had to do it.   (George is up to the teller, Jerry goes to another one.)  
p396
aa(lp397
V GEORGE 
p398
aV Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?   
p399
aa(lp400
V TELLER 
p401
aV I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that.  
p402
aa(lp403

p404
aV Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't mind.   
p405
aa(lp406
V GEORGE 
p407
aV I'm not going with him. I don't even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.   
p408
aa(lp409
V TELLER 
p410
aV Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.   
p411
aa(lp412

p414
aa(lp415
V JERRY 
p416
aV I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression "Laughing all the way to the bank." I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate    it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. "Can you get a little piece    of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please."    (Jerry's apartment)   (George is stuffing pennies into rolls.)

p431
aV Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!   
p432
aa(lp433
V JERRY 
p434
aV Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug.

p453
aa(lp454
V GEORGE 
p455
aV Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we could go?

p468
aa(lp469
V GOERGE 
p470
aV You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.

p588
aa(lp589
V ELAINE
