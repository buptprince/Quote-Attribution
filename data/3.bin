V  MALE UNBONDING  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   Most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on    something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies.    Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, "Honey, I think Jim's working on something over    there." So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men    want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, "What are you using, the Philips head?" You know,    we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. They cut those    little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. Right over there. "What are you using the    steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold."   (Jerry's apartment building)   (Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator)

p4
V I had to say something. I had to say something. Everything was going so well; I had to say something.   
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V I don't think you did anything wrong.    
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you.   
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V We can only thank God for that.   (Elevator opens, they get on)  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It's only a matter of time now.   
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V You're imagining this. Really.  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V Oh no. No, no, no, no.   (elevator doors close)  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V I'll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.    
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V What floss? When?  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my    pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.   
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Ah, mint.  
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I look up, I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..    (eleveator doors open, they get off)  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V So let me get this straight: she saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.   
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.   
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?    
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V Yes, I am.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V (looks at a carrying pouch George is wearing) You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?   
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V What? You don't like this?  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.    (they go into Jerry's apartment to find Kramer talking on the phone)   
p59
tp60
a(V KRAMER 
p61
V Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,     yeah, take my number - 555-8643. Okay, here he is. (hands phone to Jerry.)   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V (to Kramer) Who is it?  
p65
tp66
a(V KRAMER 
p67
V Take it.  
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V Who is it?  
p71
tp72
a(V KRAMER 
p73
V It's for you.  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. I was out of town. I just got back.. Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just    my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy    right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. thanks.. bye. (hangs up, then addresses Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I    hate just being handed a phone.  
p77
tp78
a(V KRAMER 
p79
V Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you   
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.    
p83
tp84
a(V KRAMER 
p85
V Well, why not?  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.   
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We're not    going?  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V We're going. That's next Wednesday.    
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V Oh. Who is this guy?  
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of     my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so self-involved.    (phone rings, Kramer pulls his phone out of his pocket)  
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica Industries.. Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own     pie.  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V Can you conduct your business elsewhere?    
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while still on the phone.)   
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.    
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit     there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.    
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.   
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him "I Don't think we're right for each other.." He's a guy. At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,     the relationship goes sour, you end it.  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V No, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Just break up with him?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.     (scene ends)   (Nightclub)  
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, "Bill, I feel I need to see other men." Do     you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See,    the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost    all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever    say is "So, what's in the refrigerator?"   (Coffee Shop)   (Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table)  
p134
tp135
a(V JOEL 
p136
V ..so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo.    
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-   
p140
tp141
a(V JOEL 
p142
V (interrupting) Hey, hey, hey, hey we're starving here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already!   
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V (testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going to Iran this summer.   
p146
tp147
a(V JOEL 
p148
V I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic.    
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it is Farsi.   
p152
tp153
a(V JOEL 
p154
V Do you think I need a haircut?   (waitress comes to their table)  
p155
tp156
a(V WAITRESS 
p157
V Are you ready?  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.   
p161
tp162
a(V JOEL 
p163
V Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't want that processed turkey. I hate it.    
p164
tp165
a(V WAITRESS 
p166
V I think it's real turkey.  
p167
tp168
a(V JOEL 
p169
V Is there a real bird in the back?  
p170
tp171
a(V WAITRESS 
p172
V No, there's not bird but-  
p173
tp174
a(V JOEL 
p175
V Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay?     (waitress leaves)  
p176
tp177
a(V JOEL 
p178
V (cont.) Unbelievable..  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V How can you talk to someone like that?    
p182
tp183
a(V JOEL 
p184
V What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?   
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you.   
p188
tp189
a(V JOEL 
p190
V Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into.    
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY AND JOEL 
p193
V Howard metro.  
p194
tp195
a(V JOEL 
p196
V He asked me if I still saw you. I said, "Sure, I see him all the time. We're great friends." Anyway, Howard says hello.   
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see each other anymore.   
p200
tp201
a(V JOEL 
p202
V what?  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V This friendship.. it's not working.    
p206
tp207
a(V JOEL 
p208
V Not working? What are you talking about?    
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V We're just not suited to be friends.    
p212
tp213
a(V JOEL 
p214
V How can you say that?  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we don't have anything in common.    
p218
tp219
a(V JOEL 
p220
V (starting to cry) Wait. Wat did I do? Tell me.. I want to know.   
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's me. It's.. this is very difficult.    
p224
tp225
a(V JOEL 
p226
V Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you're a very busy guy.    
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V No, it's not that.  
p230
tp231
a(V JOEL 
p232
V (crying) You're one of the few people I can talk to.   
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V Oh, come on. That's not true.  
p236
tp237
a(V JOEL 
p238
V I always tell everybody about you; tell everybody to go see your show. I mean, I'm your biggest fan!   
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V I know, I know.  
p242
tp243
a(V JOEL 
p244
V I mean, you're my best friend.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.   
p248
tp249
a(V JOEL 
p250
V I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't believe it.   
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't mean it.   
p254
tp255
a(V JOEL 
p256
V Didn't mean what?  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.   
p260
tp261
a(V JOEL 
p262
V Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.    
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends.    Okay? Look, I'll tell you what. I've got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.   
p266
tp267
a(V JOEL 
p268
V Tonight?  
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've said tonight.   
p272
tp273
a(V JOEL 
p274
V Do you really want me to go?  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V (faking) Yes.  
p278
tp279
a(V JOEL 
p280
V Okay. yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that'd be great.. so, next Wednesday.    
p281
tp282

p283
V Next Wednesday.  
p284
tp285
a(V JOEL 
p286
V Where is that waitress?! Hey! ..   (scene ends)   (Bank)   (Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip; George is carrying a jug full of pennies.)   
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V ..she calls me up at my office, she says, "We have to talk."   
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V Uh, the four worst words in the English language.   
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V That, or "Who's bra is this?"  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V That is worse.  
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's "not working".   
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V Really.  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or    do I eat?  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V Hm? You ate.  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.    
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Someone says, "Get out of my life!" and that doesn't affect your appetite?    
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V Have you ever had their egg salad?    
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V It is unbelievable.  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off     with a sandwich.  
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V (looking at George's penny jug) How much could you possibly have in there? GEORGE: It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I    know guy who took his vacation on change.  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?    
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V (sarcastic) That's funny. You're a funny guy.   
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V C'mon, move up.   (George moves up in the bank line)  
p338
tp339
a(V CUSTOMER 
p340
V Oh great, Ewing's hurt.  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?   
p344
tp345
a(V CUSTOMER 
p346
V A couple of days at the most but..    
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V Geez.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Oh, God.  
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.   
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Listen, George, little problem with the game.   
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V What about it?  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..   
p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V What?  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V I geve your ticket to Horneck.  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V You what?!  
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.   
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?   
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V (talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.   
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Why did you give him my ticket for?    
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V You didn't see him. It was horrible.    
p389
tp390
a(V GOERGE 
p391
V Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.    
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V I had to do it.   (George is up to the teller, Jerry goes to another one.)  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?   
p398
tp399
a(V TELLER 
p400
V I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't mind.   
p404
tp405
a(V GEORGE 
p406
V I'm not going with him. I don't even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.   
p407
tp408
a(V TELLER 
p409
V Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.   
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!     (Scene ends.)   (Nightclub)  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression "Laughing all the way to the bank." I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate    it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. "Can you get a little piece    of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please."    (Jerry's apartment)   (George is stuffing pennies into rolls.)  
p416
tp417
a(V GEORGE 
p418
V ..Thirty-two, thirty-three-  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V George.  
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V (raises his hand) Not now.. (counts to himself).   
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Could you stop the counting?  
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!   
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug.   
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.  
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.    
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V (pantomimes sticking an imaginary knife in his heart, and twists it) Oh geeeee.. Go, go!   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V I.. no, I don't want to go.  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V He was really crying?

a(V GOERGE
