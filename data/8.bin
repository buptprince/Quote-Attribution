V  THE PHONE MESSAGE  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Comedy club)   The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is    doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV    like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their     commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?    "We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through    the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're    watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising    right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,     jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much    ice in mine."      So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there,    and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her    out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I    interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm    supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -    remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what    I looked like.

a(V JERRY 
p4
V So you didn't ask?  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V No, I froze.  
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V (Points to counter) Counter.    
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office,    I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I    can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I    gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.    So Lloyd calls me a wuss.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V He said wuss?  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.    
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V So you called. (They sit at counter)    
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple,    because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it    makes you sound casual.  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V Yeah, like a farm boy.  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an    enthusiastic 'Hi!'  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.    
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic    'Hi!' Go ahead.  
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them    out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out "What are you    doing Saturday night?"  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V And?  
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V She bought.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V Great day in the morning.  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V Then I got off the phone right away.    
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of    the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.   
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't    remember the last time that happened.     George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George and his date   
p62
tp63
a(V CAROL 
p64
V  
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of    underwear.  
p68
tp69
a(V CAROL 
p70
V You do not.  
p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying    underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I    only have to do wash once a year.   (They both laugh)     Jerry's car, also parked outside an apartment building. Jerry and his    GIRLFRIEND DONNA   
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V (In awful Scots/Irish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try    a Scottish accent.  
p77
tp78
a(V DONNA 
p79
V That's Irish.  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?    (Donna laughs)     
p83
tp84
a(V DONNA 
p85
V So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great.    
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V Yeah. We should do this again.  
p89
tp90
a(V DONNA 
p91
V Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?   
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.   
p95
tp96
a(V DONNA 
p97
V (Looks disappointed) So, um, OK.  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V OK.   
p101
tp102
a(V DONNA 
p103
V Goodnight.  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V Yeah, take it easy.   (Donna leaves car. George realizes what he has done and bashes his    forehead in disgust)     
p107
tp108
a(V DONNA 
p109
V Thanks again for the movie.  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V You're welcome.  
p113
tp114
a(V DONNA 
p115
V I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.   
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Oh, that's OK.  
p119
tp120
a(V DONNA 
p121
V Unless you want to go to your place.    
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking    for.     
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V Take it easy, huh, take it easy.     
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is    leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was    brought up.  
p131
tp132
a(V DONNA 
p133
V Values are very important.  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna    have dinner?  
p137
tp138
a(V DONNA 
p139
V Thursday's great. (Moves closer)  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V (Looks at his pants) Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I    don't feel comfortable in them.  
p143
tp144
a(V DONNA 
p145
V Are those Cotton Dockers?  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.   
p149
tp150
a(V DONNA 
p151
V Really? I like that commercial. (Jerry pauses)   
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V You like that commercial?  
p155
tp156
a(V DONNA 
p157
V Yeah, it's clever.  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing    around, supposedly being very casual and witty?  
p161
tp162
a(V DONNA 
p163
V Yeah, that's the one.  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V What could you possibly like about that?    
p167
tp168
a(V DONNA 
p169
V I don't know, I like the guys.  
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I    could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and    wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.    
p173
tp174
a(V DONNA 
p175
V Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.   
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V (Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if    somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with    the pants? Doesn't that bother you?  
p179
tp180
a(V DONNA 
p181
V (Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about    it, that they're not talking about the pants.  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V But they're talking about nothing.    
p185
tp186
a(V DONNA 
p187
V That's the point.  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V I know the point.  
p191
tp192
a(V DONNA 
p193
V No one is telling you to like it.  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,    pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?     (Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry, looks at watch)     JERRY MONOLOGUE    What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other    through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,    you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like    'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the    rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What    is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my    life?'     
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with    someone who actually likes this commercial?  
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean    enough.  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?   
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his   
p209
tp210
a(V TUB 
p211
V germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.     Houses near the drain were going for $150,000.   (George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag)    
p212
tp213
a(V ELAINE 
p214
V Hi.   (George produces Pepto-Bismol bottle and box of bicarb from bag, places    them on counter)  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V You're still thinking about this?  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V (While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o clock at    night, for coffee. And I don't go up. "No thank you, I don't want coffee, it    keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee." I said this to her. People    this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think    of me.  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.   
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.   
p227
tp228
a(V ELAINE 
p229
V Maybe coffee was coffee.  
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at    night.  
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE 
p235
V Well some people drink coffee that late.    
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile     kept saying to myself "Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great."   
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I    think you should call her.  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.   
p245
tp246
a(V ELAINE 
p247
V Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.   
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who    goes (in stupid voice) "Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." If I call    her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy.   Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a    kaiser, a tsar.  
p251
tp252
a(V ELAINE 
p253
V All she'll think is that you like her.    
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like    me!  
p257
tp258
a(V ELAINE 
p259
V I don't know what your parents did to you.    (Kramer enters, points at Jerry)  
p260
tp261
a(V KRAMER 
p262
V Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,    you're up there, you're on the stage and you go "Hey, you ever notice how cars    here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore.    Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, sorry buddy,    you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages    for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'" So you gonna use it?   
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V I don't think so.  
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V It's funny.  
p269
tp270
a(V ELAINE 
p271
V It is funny.  
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V That's as good as anything you do.    
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.   
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V Why do we have to leave?  
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come    on, let's go.  
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Oh, see, this is the problem.  
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V You're kicking me out of my house?    
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V Yes.  
p293
tp294
a(V ELAINE 
p295
V Don't forget.  
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.    (Elaine, Kramer and Jerry leave. George removes jacket, dials phone)   
p302
tp303
a(V PHONE 
p304
V Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you. (Beep)   
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that    didn't come up for coffee.   You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean ... well,    whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so,    you call me back. If you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do.    Either way. The ball's in your court. So, er, take it easy.     (Hangs up. Jerry enters)  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the    matter, did you call?   (Elaine enters)  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead,    I'm a dead man. Dead man.  
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V What did you say?  
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and    there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right   
p320
tp321
a(V NOW 
p322
V 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'   
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V After one date you try and improvise on her machine?   
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V Now I'm in the worst position of all.    
p329
tp330
a(V ELAINE 
p331
V Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,    and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would    have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy    came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.    
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V He did that?  
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V Yeah.  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V Somebody did that?  
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V She'll call you back. You're overreacting.       
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V Not once.  
p347
tp348
a(V DONNA 
p349
V Never?  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.   
p353
tp354
a(V DONNA 
p355
V That's amazing.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Thank you.  
p359
tp360
a(V DONNA 
p361
V Is there anything else about you I should know?   
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.  
p365
tp366
a(V DONNA 
p367
V Really?  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm,    I'll be right back. (Goes to bathroom)   (George enters)  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V Wait till you hear this (sees Donna). Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I    didn't, I had no idea. (Goes to leave)  
p374
tp375
a(V DONNA 
p376
V Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom.  
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back.   
p380
tp381
a(V DONNA 
p382
V You don't have to leave.  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V You sure?  
p386
tp387
a(V DONNA 
p388
V Yes.  
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V OK.   
p392
tp393
a(V DONNA 
p394
V I'm Donna.  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!   
p398
tp399
a(V DONNA 
p400
V He told you about that.  
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about    that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial.    No, he, he would never tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything.    He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him.. (Jerry re-    enters)  
p404
tp405
a(V DONNA 
p406
V (To Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip    because I like that commercial.  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V What? (To George) What did, what did you say?   
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V Say? What? Nothing, I..  
p413
tp414
a(V DONNA 
p415
V You told him how I like the commercial.    
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Well, so what if I said that?  
p419
tp420
a(V DONNA 
p421
V Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.   
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.   
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V (To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?   
p428
tp429
a(V DONNA 
p430
V I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.   
p431
tp432
a(V GEORGE 
p433
V Boy oh boy.  
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?   
p437
tp438
a(V DONNA 
p439
V I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the    commercial.  
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.    (Kramer enters)   K Hey.  
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.   k Oh. Cotton Dockers!  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .(Grabs Kramer)    k What? Where are we going?  
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V Come on!  
p452

V Don't bother, I'm leaving.  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Donna, really, you're making too much of this.    K One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just    pants!  
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Please, Donna.  
p461
tp462
a(V DONNA 
p463
V I don't wanna hear it.(Leaves)  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE 
p466
V I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.   
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.    k What happened there?  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V I'll tell you later.  
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475
V You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.        
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call    back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the    MACHINE AGAIN  "I know you're there, I don't know what your story is."    Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and fly    like Mussolini from the balcony- "Where the hell do you get the nerve? You    invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't    like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the    coffee just so I could spit it in your face."  
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V You said that?  
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V I lost it.  
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.   
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V She did. Today.  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V What?  
p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since    Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine    broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for    it.  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V So she didn't get the messages.  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to    see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she    gets home.  
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V But what about the messages?   (George produces cassette tape from pocket)  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?    
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V I'll meet her outside the building.    
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right    for that machine.  
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I    kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those    stupid machines.  
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.   
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V You do it for me.  
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V What?  
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V Come on, it'll be so much easier.  
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V How you gonna get me up there?  
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.   
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V And who makes the switch?  
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V You do.  
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V I do.  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.    
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V I can't get involved in this.  
p551
tp552
a(V GEORGE 
p553
V I think I may be in love with this woman.    
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V What if she sees me?  
p557
tp558
a(V GEORGE 
p559
V Oh, you are such a wuss.  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V A wuss?  
p563
tp564
a(V GEORGE 
p565
V Yeah.  
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Did you call me a wuss?     
p569
tp570
a(V GEORGE 
p571
V Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.   
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now,    what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me    that she's coming.  
p575
tp576
a(V GEORGE 
p577
V A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy    toe!'  
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.  
p581
tp582
a(V GEORGE 
p583
V You don't like 'Tippy toe?'  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V No 'Tippy toe.'  
p587
tp588
a(V GEORGE 
p589
V Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing.   
p590
tp591
a(V JERRY 
p592
V What song?  
p593
tp594
a(V GEORGE 
p595
V Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'   
p596
tp597
a(V JERRY 
p598
V What is that?  
p599
tp600
a(V GEORGE 
p601
V Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem like    Maria?  
p602
tp603
a(V JERRY 
p604
V Anything else?  
p605
tp606

p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE

a(V JERRY 
p625
V (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro.  
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V How do you feel? Confident?  
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY

V Feel good.  
p632
tp633

p634
V You nervous?  
p635

p637
V Not at all.  
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to    death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!   (Carol arrives)  
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you    when I got home.  
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE

V I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.   
p647
tp648
a(V CAROL 
p649
V Oh, that's so sweet.  
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him    around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all    the time.  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V All the time.  
p656
tp657
a(V CAROL

V It's nice to meet you.  
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V Hi.  
p662
tp663
a(V CAROL 
p664
V So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?   
p665
tp666
a(V GEORGE 
p667
V You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a    ride home.  
p668
tp669
a(V CAROL 
p670
V OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?   
p671
tp672
a(V GEORGE 
p673
V Don't you wanna go upstairs first?    
p674
tp675
a(V CAROL 
p676
V No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman.   
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V You know, I really need to use the bathroom.    
p680

V Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.   
p683

V Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...   
p686
tp687
a(V CAROL 
p688
V Well they have a phone.   (George takes Carol to one side)  
p689
tp690
a(V GEORGE 
p691
V I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we    really should go upstairs.  
p692
tp693
a(V CAROL 
p694
V (Aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my    machine.  
p695
tp696

p697
V Right, right.   (They enter building)     
p698

V Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.   
p710
tp711
a(V CAROL 
p712
V Oh that's weird.  
p713
tp714
a(V GEORGE 
p715
V No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical    journals. It's a freak thing, but...  
p716
tp717
a(V CAROL 
p718
V Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go.   
p719
tp720

p731
tp732
a(V CAROL 
p733
V (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen    you, it's driving me crazy.  
p734
tp735
a(V JERRY 
p736
V Right. I am.  
p737
tp738
a(V GEORGE 
p739
V Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if    you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.   (George leads Carol back out, Jerry switches tapes)  
p740
tp741
a(V JERRY 
p742
V (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.     (George and Carol return)  
p743
tp744
a(V CAROL 
p745
V That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the    pool?  
p746
tp747
a(V GEORGE 
p748
V (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?    
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V Yes.  
p752
tp753
a(V CAROL 
p754
V Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here,    let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour    called me and played my messages to me over the phone.  
p755
tp756
a(V GEORGE 
p757
V Oh, uhhh...  
p758
