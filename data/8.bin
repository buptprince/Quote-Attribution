aV  THE PHONE MESSAGE  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Comedy club)   The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is    doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV    like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their     commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?    "We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through    the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're    watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising    right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,     jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much    ice in mine."      So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there,    and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her    out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I    interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm    supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -    remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what    I looked like.

aa(lp4
V JERRY 
p5
aV So you didn't ask?  
p6
aa(lp7
V GEORGE 
p8
aV No, I froze.  
p9
aa(lp10
V JERRY 
p11
aV (Points to counter) Counter.    
p12
aa(lp13
V GEORGE 
p14
aV Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office,    I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I    can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I    gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.    So Lloyd calls me a wuss.  
p15
aa(lp16
V JERRY 
p17
aV He said wuss?  
p18
aa(lp19
V GEORGE 
p20
aV Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.    
p21
aa(lp22
V JERRY 
p23
aV So you called. (They sit at counter)    
p24
aa(lp25
V GEORGE 
p26
aV Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple,    because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it    makes you sound casual.  
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV Yeah, like a farm boy.  
p30
aa(lp31
V GEORGE 
p32
aV Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an    enthusiastic 'Hi!'  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.    
p36
aa(lp37
V GEORGE 
p38
aV Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.   
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic    'Hi!' Go ahead.  
p42
aa(lp43
V GEORGE 
p44
aV So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them    out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out "What are you    doing Saturday night?"  
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV And?  
p48
aa(lp49
V GEORGE 
p50
aV She bought.  
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV Great day in the morning.  
p54
aa(lp55
V GEORGE 
p56
aV Then I got off the phone right away.    
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY 
p59
aV Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of    the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.   
p60
aa(lp61
V GEORGE 
p62
aV It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't    remember the last time that happened.     George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George and his date   
p63
aa(lp64
V CAROL 
p65
aV  
p66
aa(lp67
V GEORGE 
p68
aV I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of    underwear.  
p69
aa(lp70
V CAROL 
p71
aV You do not.  
p72
aa(lp73
V GEORGE 
p74
aV Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying    underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I    only have to do wash once a year.   (They both laugh)     Jerry's car, also parked outside an apartment building. Jerry and his    GIRLFRIEND DONNA   
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV (In awful Scots/Irish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try    a Scottish accent.  
p78
aa(lp79
V DONNA 
p80
aV That's Irish.  
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?    (Donna laughs)     
p84
aa(lp85
V DONNA 
p86
aV So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great.    
p87
aa(lp88
V GEORGE 
p89
aV Yeah. We should do this again.  
p90
aa(lp91
V DONNA 
p92
aV Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?   
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.   
p96
aa(lp97
V DONNA 
p98
aV (Looks disappointed) So, um, OK.  
p99
aa(lp100
V GEORGE 
p101
aV OK.   
p102
aa(lp103
V DONNA 
p104
aV Goodnight.  
p105
aa(lp106
V GEORGE 
p107
aV Yeah, take it easy.   (Donna leaves car. George realizes what he has done and bashes his    forehead in disgust)     
p108
aa(lp109
V DONNA 
p110
aV Thanks again for the movie.  
p111
aa(lp112
V JERRY 
p113
aV You're welcome.  
p114
aa(lp115
V DONNA 
p116
aV I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.   
p117
aa(lp118
V JERRY 
p119
aV Oh, that's OK.  
p120
aa(lp121
V DONNA 
p122
aV Unless you want to go to your place.    
p123
aa(lp124
V JERRY 
p125
aV OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking    for.     
p126
aa(lp127
V GEORGE 
p128
aV Take it easy, huh, take it easy.     
p129
aa(lp130
V JERRY 
p131
aV I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is    leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was    brought up.  
p132
aa(lp133
V DONNA 
p134
aV Values are very important.  
p135
aa(lp136
V JERRY 
p137
aV Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna    have dinner?  
p138
aa(lp139
V DONNA 
p140
aV Thursday's great. (Moves closer)  
p141
aa(lp142
V JERRY 
p143
aV (Looks at his pants) Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I    don't feel comfortable in them.  
p144
aa(lp145
V DONNA 
p146
aV Are those Cotton Dockers?  
p147
aa(lp148
V JERRY 
p149
aV Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.   
p150
aa(lp151
V DONNA 
p152
aV Really? I like that commercial. (Jerry pauses)   
p153
aa(lp154
V JERRY 
p155
aV You like that commercial?  
p156
aa(lp157
V DONNA 
p158
aV Yeah, it's clever.  
p159
aa(lp160
V JERRY 
p161
aV Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing    around, supposedly being very casual and witty?  
p162
aa(lp163
V DONNA 
p164
aV Yeah, that's the one.  
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV What could you possibly like about that?    
p168
aa(lp169
V DONNA 
p170
aV I don't know, I like the guys.  
p171
aa(lp172
V JERRY 
p173
aV Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I    could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and    wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.    
p174
aa(lp175
V DONNA 
p176
aV Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.   
p177
aa(lp178
V JERRY 
p179
aV (Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if    somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with    the pants? Doesn't that bother you?  
p180
aa(lp181
V DONNA 
p182
aV (Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about    it, that they're not talking about the pants.  
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV But they're talking about nothing.    
p186
aa(lp187
V DONNA 
p188
aV That's the point.  
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV I know the point.  
p192
aa(lp193
V DONNA 
p194
aV No one is telling you to like it.  
p195
aa(lp196
V JERRY 
p197
aV I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,    pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?     (Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry, looks at watch)     JERRY MONOLOGUE    What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other    through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,    you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like    'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the    rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What    is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my    life?'     
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with    someone who actually likes this commercial?  
p201
aa(lp202
V ELAINE 
p203
aV I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean    enough.  
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY 
p206
aV No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?   
p207
aa(lp208
V ELAINE 
p209
aV Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his   
p210
aa(lp211
V TUB 
p212
aV germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.     Houses near the drain were going for $150,000.   (George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag)    
p213
aa(lp214
V ELAINE 
p215
aV Hi.   (George produces Pepto-Bismol bottle and box of bicarb from bag, places    them on counter)  
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV You're still thinking about this?  
p219
aa(lp220
V GEORGE 
p221
aV (While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o clock at    night, for coffee. And I don't go up. "No thank you, I don't want coffee, it    keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee." I said this to her. People    this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think    of me.  
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.   
p225
aa(lp226
V GEORGE 
p227
aV She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.   
p228
aa(lp229
V ELAINE 
p230
aV Maybe coffee was coffee.  
p231
aa(lp232
V GEORGE 
p233
aV Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at    night.  
p234
aa(lp235
V ELAINE 
p236
aV Well some people drink coffee that late.    
p237
aa(lp238
V GEORGE 
p239
aV Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile     kept saying to myself "Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great."   
p240
aa(lp241
V ELAINE 
p242
aV It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I    think you should call her.  
p243
aa(lp244
V GEORGE 
p245
aV I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.   
p246
aa(lp247
V ELAINE 
p248
aV Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.   
p249
aa(lp250
V GEORGE 
p251
aV Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who    goes (in stupid voice) "Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." If I call    her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy.   Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a    kaiser, a tsar.  
p252
aa(lp253
V ELAINE 
p254
aV All she'll think is that you like her.    
p255
aa(lp256
V GEORGE 
p257
aV Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like    me!  
p258
aa(lp259
V ELAINE 
p260
aV I don't know what your parents did to you.    (Kramer enters, points at Jerry)  
p261
aa(lp262
V KRAMER 
p263
aV Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,    you're up there, you're on the stage and you go "Hey, you ever notice how cars    here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore.    Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, sorry buddy,    you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages    for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'" So you gonna use it?   
p264
aa(lp265
V JERRY 
p266
aV I don't think so.  
p267
aa(lp268
V KRAMER 
p269
aV It's funny.  
p270
aa(lp271
V ELAINE 
p272
aV It is funny.  
p273
aa(lp274
V KRAMER 
p275
aV That's as good as anything you do.    
p276
aa(lp277
V GEORGE 
p278
aV Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.   
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV Why do we have to leave?  
p282
aa(lp283
V GEORGE 
p284
aV Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come    on, let's go.  
p285
aa(lp286
V ELAINE 
p287
aV Oh, see, this is the problem.  
p288
aa(lp289
V JERRY 
p290
aV You're kicking me out of my house?    
p291
aa(lp292
V GEORGE 
p293
aV Yes.  
p294
aa(lp295
V ELAINE 
p296
aV Don't forget.  
p297
aa(lp298
V GEORGE 
p299
aV Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?  
p300
aa(lp301
V JERRY 
p302
aV Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.    (Elaine, Kramer and Jerry leave. George removes jacket, dials phone)   
p303
aa(lp304
V PHONE 
p305
aV Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you. (Beep)   
p306
aa(lp307
V GEORGE 
p308
aV Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that    didn't come up for coffee.   You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean ... well,    whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so,    you call me back. If you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do.    Either way. The ball's in your court. So, er, take it easy.     (Hangs up. Jerry enters)  
p309
aa(lp310
V JERRY 
p311
aV I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the    matter, did you call?   (Elaine enters)  
p312
aa(lp313
V GEORGE 
p314
aV Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead,    I'm a dead man. Dead man.  
p315
aa(lp316
V JERRY 
p317
aV What did you say?  
p318
aa(lp319
V GEORGE 
p320
aV I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and    there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right   
p321
aa(lp322
V NOW 
p323
aV 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'   
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV After one date you try and improvise on her machine?   
p327
aa(lp328
V GEORGE 
p329
aV Now I'm in the worst position of all.    
p330
aa(lp331
V ELAINE 
p332
aV Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,    and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would    have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy    came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.    
p333
aa(lp334
V GEORGE 
p335
aV He did that?  
p336
aa(lp337
V ELAINE 
p338
aV Yeah.  
p339
aa(lp340
V GEORGE 
p341
aV Somebody did that?  
p342
aa(lp343
V JERRY 
p344
aV She'll call you back. You're overreacting.       
p345
aa(lp346
V JERRY 
p347
aV Not once.  
p348
aa(lp349
V DONNA 
p350
aV Never?  
p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY 
p353
aV I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.   
p354
aa(lp355
V DONNA 
p356
aV That's amazing.  
p357
aa(lp358
V JERRY 
p359
aV Thank you.  
p360
aa(lp361
V DONNA 
p362
aV Is there anything else about you I should know?   
p363
aa(lp364
V JERRY 
p365
aV Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.  
p366
aa(lp367
V DONNA 
p368
aV Really?  
p369
aa(lp370
V JERRY 
p371
aV I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm,    I'll be right back. (Goes to bathroom)   (George enters)  
p372
aa(lp373
V GEORGE 
p374
aV Wait till you hear this (sees Donna). Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I    didn't, I had no idea. (Goes to leave)  
p375
aa(lp376
V DONNA 
p377
aV Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom.  
p378
aa(lp379
V GEORGE 
p380
aV I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back.   
p381
aa(lp382
V DONNA 
p383
aV You don't have to leave.  
p384
aa(lp385
V GEORGE 
p386
aV You sure?  
p387
aa(lp388
V DONNA 
p389
aV Yes.  
p390
aa(lp391
V GEORGE 
p392
aV OK.   
p393
aa(lp394
V DONNA 
p395
aV I'm Donna.  
p396
aa(lp397
V GEORGE 
p398
aV Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!   
p399
aa(lp400
V DONNA 
p401
aV He told you about that.  
p402
aa(lp403
V GEORGE 
p404
aV No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about    that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial.    No, he, he would never tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything.    He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him.. (Jerry re-    enters)  
p405
aa(lp406
V DONNA 
p407
aV (To Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip    because I like that commercial.  
p408
aa(lp409
V JERRY 
p410
aV What? (To George) What did, what did you say?   
p411
aa(lp412
V GEORGE 
p413
aV Say? What? Nothing, I..  
p414
aa(lp415
V DONNA 
p416
aV You told him how I like the commercial.    
p417
aa(lp418
V JERRY 
p419
aV Well, so what if I said that?  
p420
aa(lp421
V DONNA 
p422
aV Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.   
p423
aa(lp424
V JERRY 
p425
aV No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.   
p426
aa(lp427
V GEORGE 
p428
aV (To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?   
p429
aa(lp430
V DONNA 
p431
aV I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.   
p432
aa(lp433
V GEORGE 
p434
aV Boy oh boy.  
p435
aa(lp436
V JERRY 
p437
aV I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?   
p438
aa(lp439
V DONNA 
p440
aV I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the    commercial.  
p441
aa(lp442
V JERRY

aV Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.    (Kramer enters)   K Hey.  
p444
aa(lp445
V JERRY 
p446
aV Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.   k Oh. Cotton Dockers!  
p447
aa(lp448
V GEORGE 
p449
aV Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .(Grabs Kramer)    k What? Where are we going?  
p450
aa(lp451
V GEORGE 
p452
aV Come on!  
p453
aa(lp454
V DONNA 
p455
aV Don't bother, I'm leaving.  
p456
aa(lp457
V JERRY 
p458
aV Donna, really, you're making too much of this.    K One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just    pants!  
p459
aa(lp460
V JERRY 
p461
aV Please, Donna.  
p462
aa(lp463
V DONNA 
p464
aV I don't wanna hear it.(Leaves)  
p465
aa(lp466
V GEORGE 
p467
aV I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.   
p468
aa(lp469
V JERRY 
p470
aV Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.    k What happened there?  
p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV I'll tell you later.  
p474
aa(lp475
V GEORGE 
p476
aV You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.        
p477
aa(lp478
V GEORGE 
p479
aV OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call    back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the    MACHINE AGAIN  "I know you're there, I don't know what your story is."    Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and fly    like Mussolini from the balcony- "Where the hell do you get the nerve? You    invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't    like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the    coffee just so I could spit it in your face."  
p480
aa(lp481
V JERRY 
p482
aV You said that?  
p483
aa(lp484
V GEORGE 
p485
aV I lost it.  
p486
aa(lp487
V JERRY 
p488
aV I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.   
p489
aa(lp490
V GEORGE 
p491
aV She did. Today.  
p492
aa(lp493
V JERRY 
p494
aV What?  
p495
aa(lp496
V GEORGE 
p497
aV She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since    Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine    broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for    it.  
p498
aa(lp499
V JERRY 
p500
aV So she didn't get the messages.  
p501
aa(lp502
V GEORGE 
p503
aV Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to    see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she    gets home.  
p504
aa(lp505
V JERRY 
p506
aV But what about the messages?   (George produces cassette tape from pocket)  
p507
aa(lp508
V JERRY 
p509
aV Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?    
p510
aa(lp511
V GEORGE 
p512
aV I'll meet her outside the building.    
p513
aa(lp514
V JERRY 
p515
aV But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right    for that machine.  
p516
aa(lp517
V GEORGE 
p518
aV Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I    kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those    stupid machines.  
p519
aa(lp520
V JERRY 
p521
aV There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.   
p522
aa(lp523
V GEORGE 
p524
aV You do it for me.  
p525
aa(lp526
V JERRY 
p527
aV What?  
p528
aa(lp529
V GEORGE 
p530
aV Come on, it'll be so much easier.  
p531
aa(lp532
V JERRY 
p533
aV How you gonna get me up there?  
p534
aa(lp535
V GEORGE 
p536
aV I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.   
p537
aa(lp538
V JERRY 
p539
aV And who makes the switch?  
p540
aa(lp541
V GEORGE 
p542
aV You do.  
p543
aa(lp544
V JERRY 
p545
aV I do.  
p546
aa(lp547
V GEORGE 
p548
aV I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.    
p549
aa(lp550
V JERRY 
p551
aV I can't get involved in this.  
p552
aa(lp553
V GEORGE 
p554
aV I think I may be in love with this woman.    
p555
aa(lp556
V JERRY 
p557
aV What if she sees me?  
p558
aa(lp559
V GEORGE 
p560
aV Oh, you are such a wuss.  
p561
aa(lp562
V JERRY 
p563
aV A wuss?  
p564
aa(lp565
V GEORGE 
p566
aV Yeah.  
p567
aa(lp568
V JERRY 
p569
aV Did you call me a wuss?     
p570
aa(lp571
V GEORGE 
p572
aV Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.   
p573
aa(lp574
V JERRY 
p575
aV I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now,    what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me    that she's coming.  
p576
aa(lp577
V GEORGE 
p578
aV A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy    toe!'  
p579
aa(lp580
V JERRY 
p581
aV 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.  
p582
aa(lp583
V GEORGE 
p584
aV You don't like 'Tippy toe?'  
p585
aa(lp586
V JERRY 
p587
aV No 'Tippy toe.'  
p588
aa(lp589
V GEORGE 
p590
aV Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing.   
p591
aa(lp592
V JERRY 
p593
aV What song?  
p594
aa(lp595
V GEORGE 
p596
aV Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'   
p597
aa(lp598
V JERRY 
p599
aV What is that?  
p600
aa(lp601
V GEORGE 
p602
aV Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem like    Maria?  
p603
aa(lp604
V JERRY 
p605
aV Anything else?  
p606
aa(lp607
V GEORGE

aV You pick it.

aV (Singing) Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower   
p621
aa(lp622
V GEORGE 
p623
aV You got the tape?  
p624
aa(lp625
V JERRY 
p626
aV (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro.  
p627
aa(lp628
V GEORGE 
p629
aV How do you feel? Confident?  
p630
aa(lp631
V JERRY 
p632
aV Feel good.  
p633
aa(lp634
V GEORGE 
p635
aV You nervous?  
p636
aa(lp637
V JERRY 
p638
aV Not at all.  
p639
aa(lp640
V GEORGE 
p641
aV Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to    death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!   (Carol arrives)  
p642
aa(lp643
V GEORGE 
p644
aV Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you    when I got home.  
p645
aa(lp646
V GEORGE 
p647
aV I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.   
p648
aa(lp649
V CAROL 
p650
aV Oh, that's so sweet.  
p651
aa(lp652
V GEORGE 
p653
aV Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him    around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all    the time.  
p654
aa(lp655
V JERRY 
p656
aV All the time.  
p657
aa(lp658

aV It's nice to meet you.  
p660
aa(lp661
V JERRY 
p662
aV Hi.  
p663
aa(lp664
V CAROL 
p665
aV So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?   
p666
aa(lp667
V GEORGE 
p668
aV You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a    ride home.  
p669
aa(lp670
V CAROL 
p671
aV OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?   
p672
aa(lp673

aV Don't you wanna go upstairs first?    
p675
aa(lp676
V CAROL 
p677
aV No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman.   
p678
aa(lp679
V JERRY

aV Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...   
p687
aa(lp688
V CAROL 
p689
aV Well they have a phone.   (George takes Carol to one side)  
p690
aa(lp691
V GEORGE 
p692
aV I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we    really should go upstairs.  
p693
aa(lp694
V CAROL 
p695
aV (Aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my    machine.  
p696

p699

p705

p710
aV Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.   
p711
aa(lp712
V CAROL 
p713
aV Oh that's weird.  
p714
aa(lp715
V GEORGE 
p716
aV No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical    journals. It's a freak thing, but...  
p717
aa(lp718
V CAROL 
p719
aV Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go.   
p720

p732
aa(lp733
V CAROL 
p734
aV (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen    you, it's driving me crazy.  
p735
aa(lp736
V JERRY 
p737
aV Right. I am.  
p738
aa(lp739
V GEORGE 
p740
aV Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if    you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.   (George leads Carol back out, Jerry switches tapes)  
p741
aa(lp742
V JERRY 
p743
aV (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.     (George and Carol return)  
p744
aa(lp745
V CAROL 
p746
aV That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the    pool?  
p747
aa(lp748
V GEORGE 
p749
aV (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?    
p750
aa(lp751
V JERRY 
p752
aV Yes.  
p753
aa(lp754
V CAROL 
p755
aV Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here,    let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour    called me and played my messages to me over the phone.  
p756
aa(lp757
V GEORGE 
p758
aV Oh, uhhh...  
p759
