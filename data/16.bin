V  THE BUSBOY  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Night club)   I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls    off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a    hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little    book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating    from the restaurant? What is this about?      (A restaurant)   (Jerry, George, and Elaine are all eating at an Italian restaurant. George hasn't eaten anything)

a(V ELAINE 
p4
V Do you want some of mine?  
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V Take some of mine.  
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.   
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Who said you have to like it?  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.   
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V I don't like pesto.  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V Where was pesto 10 years ago?  
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age    wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.  
p26
tp27
a(V ELAINE 
p28
V (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns     back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.   (George has started eating Elaine's food - and continues to do so)   
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.    
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.   
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.   
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Who?  
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.    
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V A guy?  
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.    
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V He's from a.. Yakima, right?  
p53
tp54
a(V ELAINE 
p55
V Seattle.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V Everybody's moving to Seattle.  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V It's the pesto of cities. So..?  
p62
tp63
a(V ELAINE 
p64
V (To Jerry) You tell him.  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.   
p68
tp69
a(V ELAINE 
p70
V Ed.  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Who was in town on a business venture, and um..   
p74
tp75
a(V ELAINE 
p76
V ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.   
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.   
p80
tp81
a(V ELAINE 
p82
V On some people.  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V Oooh.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.   
p89
tp90
a(V ELAINE 
p91
V It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.    (The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out.    The manager approaches)  
p92
tp93
a(V MANAGER 
p94
V What happened?  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.   
p98
tp99
a(V MANAGER 
p100
V Sorry to the disturbance.  
p101
tp102
a(V ELAINE 
p103
V (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.    (Manager leaves)  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining     room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.  
p107
tp108
a(V GEORGE 
p109
V Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The    busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!   
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINE 
p112
V I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.    
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.     (The busboy takes of his apron, throws it down, and exits the restaurant)   
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!   
p119
tp120
a(V ELAINE 
p121
V Oh, I said it in a kidding way.  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V I didn't know he'd get fired.  
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!    
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.   
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Was it my fault?  
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V Was it my fault?  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.       (Jerry's apartment)  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of    grueling interviews.  
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.   
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Oh, like you do.  
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.    
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V (Scoffing) Camp.  
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.    (The intercom buzzes, Jerry talks through it)  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Elaine?  
p164
tp165
a(V ELAINE 
p166
V (Through intercom) Yeah.   (Jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in)  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.   
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V Then why don't you try and get him another job?   
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.    (Elaine enters)  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.    
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V What? Did you get the busboy's number?    
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my    job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?   (Jerry hands the car keys to Elaine)  
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V How did you get all this?  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?   
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.   
p194
tp195
a(V GEORGE 
p196
V (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.    
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V You, you're going now?  
p200
tp201
a(V GEORGE 
p202
V Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?   
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.   
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?    
p212
tp213
a(V GEORGE 
p214
V It'll take to long.   (Kramer enters)  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Take the K-man. A little support..    
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V (Unsure) I don't a..  
p221
tp222
a(V KRAMER 
p223
V Take me where? Where?      (An apartment building hallway)   (George's nervous - standing with Kramer infront of the busboy's apartment)   
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.   
p227
tp228
a(V KRAMER 
p229
V What am I gonna say?  
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V I don't know.  
p233
tp234
a(V KRAMER 
p235
V Well, I'm not an idiot.  
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V Certainly not.  
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V Then we're cool.  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother    you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey)    I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I    just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.    
p245
tp246
a(V KRAMER 
p247
V (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.   
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V This is a guy I know.. Kramer.   (Antonio, the busboy, is watching them suspiciously)  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V ¿Habla espanol?  
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V (To himself) Oh my God.  
p257
tp258
a(V ANTONIO 
p259
V Si.  
p260
tp261
a(V KRAMER 
p262
V ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.     (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.  
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.   
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)   
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V Hurry up.  
p278
tp279
a(V ANTONIO 
p280
V (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)   
p281
tp282
a(V KRAMER 
p283
V His cat's gone.  
p284
tp285
a(V ANTONIO 
p286
V (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door    open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)       (Antonio's apartment)   (All three sit in silence)  
p287
tp288
a(V KRAMER 
p289
V ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in     their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.   
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A     lamp breaks) the lamp.  
p293
tp294
a(V KRAMER 
p295
V The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.    
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him,     angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)   
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)       (Jerry's apartment)  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.    (Kramer enters)  
p305
tp306
a(V KRAMER 
p307
V Hey.  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine.    (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.   
p311
tp312
a(V KRAMER 
p313
V It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.   
p317
tp318
a(V KRAMER 
p319
V Oh? How do you figure?  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.   
p323
tp324
a(V KRAMER 
p325
V Why was I in charge of closing the door?    
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!   
p329
tp330
a(V KRAMER 
p331
V So!  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!   
p335
tp336
a(V KRAMER 
p337
V Let me talk to him.  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)   
p341
tp342
a(V ELAINE 
p343
V Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?    (Jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom)    
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V No hello?  
p347
tp348
a(V ELAINE 
p349
V Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?   
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.  
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my    life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.    
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?   
p359
tp360
a(V ELAINE 
p361
V I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?   
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?    
p365
tp366
a(V ELAINE 
p367
V Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!    
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V So, you two been, uh..  
p371
tp372
a(V ELAIEN 
p373
V No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to    go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..    
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V What's your airport route?  
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.   
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V ..What about the Van Wyck?  
p383
tp384
a(V ELAINE 
p385
V I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.   
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Oooh.  
p389
tp390
a(V ELAINE 
p391
V Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?   
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V You still using that old alarm clock?    
p395
tp396
a(V ELAIEN 
p397
V Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in     the face.      (Night club)  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss     that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it,    that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon,    you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a    second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net    immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."        (Elaine's apartment)    15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)    
p401
tp402
a(V ELAINE 
p403
V (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's  9:15!   
p404
tp405
a(V ED 
p406
V 9:15?   
p407
tp408
a(V ELAINE 
p409
V Yes! 9:15!  
p410
tp411
a(V ED 
p412
V (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.   
p413
tp414
a(V ELAINE 
p415
V Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get    dressed! Get dressed!  
p416
tp417
a(V ED 
p418
V Can I shower?  
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!    
p422
tp423
a(V ED 
p424
V I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.   
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase.     He walks tward the door) Where are you going?  
p428
tp429
a(V ED 
p430
V The kitchen.  
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433

a(V ED

V I've got a bag of cashews in there.    
p437

a(V ELAINE 
p439
V They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!   
p440
tp441
a(V ED 
p442
V What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.   
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!   
p446
tp447
a(V ED 
p448
V I'll never make it.  
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Don't say that!  
p452
tp453
a(V ED 
p454
V But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.   
p455
tp456
a(V ELAINE 
p457
V Shut up and pack!  
p458
tp459
a(V ED 
p460
V And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?   
p461
tp462
a(V ELAINE 
p463
V You're talking too much!  
p464
tp465
a(V ED 
p466
V Where's my sweater?  
p467
tp468
a(V ELAINE 
p469
V What?!  
p470
tp471
a(V ED 
p472
V My brown sweater.  
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V What? What sweater?  
p476
tp477
a(V ED 
p478
V My brown sweater.  
p479
tp480
a(V ELAINE 
p481
V You didn't bring a brown sweater.  
p482
tp483
a(V ED 
p484
V I brought a brown sweater.  
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!   
p488
tp489
a(V ED 
p490
V That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.    
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)   
p494
tp495
a(V ED 
p496
V What are you doing?!  
p497
tp498
a(V ELAINE 
p499
V NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)    
p500
tp501
a(V ED 
p502
V My shoes. You packed my shoes.  
p503
tp504
a(V ELAINE 
p505
V Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over     her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!       (Jerry's apartment)  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V Anywhere in the city?  
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.   
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?  
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.   
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.  
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.    (Elaine enters. She's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat. Her hair is messed up. She's been through quite an ordeal)    
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in     slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws    of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's    ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway    Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.    (Kramer enters)  
p527
tp528
a(V KRAMER 
p529
V ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!   
p530
tp531
a(V GEORGE 
p532
V The busboy's coming?  
p533
tp534
a(V JERRY 
p535
V You don't mean here?  
p536
tp537
a(V KRAMER 
p538
V Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..   
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.   
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V Where are you going?  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.   
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.   
p551
tp552
a(V KRAMER 
p553
V No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.   
p554
tp555
a(V GEORGE 
p556
V Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me.  I..    (There's a knock in the hallway)  
p557
tp558
a(V KRAMER 
p559
V Antonio. In here!   (Antonio enters)  
p560
tp561
a(V GEORGE 
p562
V (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?    (Antonio crosses over to George, and gives him a hug)  
p563
tp564
a(V ANTONIO 
p565
V Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired    that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)   
p566
tp567
a(V GEORGE 
p568
V (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..     (The intercom buzzes)  
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V (Into the intercom) Yeah?  
p572
tp573
a(V ED 
p574
V It's Eddie.  
p575
tp576
a(V ELAINE 
p577
V He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..   
p578
tp579
a(V ANTONIO 
p580
V And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making    before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am    starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)    (Everyone ad-libs congratulations to George. Then, we hear a fight erupting from the hallway)   
p581
tp582
a(V ED 
p583
V Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!   
p584
tp585
a(V ANTONIO 
p586
V Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!   
p587
tp588
a(V ED 
p589
V Who do you think you're talking to, pal?   
p590
tp591
a(V ANTONIO 
p592
V Hey, get your hands off me!  
p593
tp594
a(V ED 
p595
V Go to hell!   (Antonio screams out profanity in Spanish, then we hear them getting into a serious fight)       (Coffee shop)  
p596
tp597
a(V JERRY 
p598
V He'll get another job. He's a busboy!    
p599
tp600
a(V GEORGE 
p601
V It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.   
p602
tp603
a(V JERRY 
p604
V It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.   
p605
tp606
a(V GEORGE 
p607
V That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.   
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.   
p611
tp612
a(V GEORGE 
p613
V So, much longer?  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?   
p617
tp618
a(V GEORGE 
p619
V (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.   
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)  
p623
tp624
a(V GEORGE 
p625
V I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.    
p626
tp627
a(V JERRY 
p628
V Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?       (Night club)
