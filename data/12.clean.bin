Vkramer
p329
aVno, no, he's out. he got out. see, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. it's all politics. but he's a rebel.
p330
aa(lp331
Vjerry
p332
aVa rebel? no. johnny yuma was a rebel. eckman is a nut. george, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. with a doctor.
p333
aa(lp334
Vkramer
p335
aVhe's holistic, george. he's holistic.
p336
aa(lp337
Vgeorge
p338
aVholistic that sounds right.
p339
aa(lp340
Vjerry
p341
aVgeorge, you need a medical doctor.
p342
aa(lp343
Vgeorge
p344
aVlet me ask you something how much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
p345
aa(lp346
Vjerry
p347
aVwell, an overnight stay in a hospital? minor surgery? i dunno, four grand.
p348
aa(lp349
Vgeorge
p350
aVuh-huh. and how much does the healer charge?
p351
aa(lp352
Vkramer
p353
aVfirst visit? thirty-eight bucks.
p354
aa(lp355
Vgeorge
p356
aVoh, yeah? holistic that's what i need. that's the answer.

p360
aa(lp361
Vjerry
p362
aVdon't flatter yourself, my friend. i'm here strictly for material, and i have a feeling this is a potential gold mine i still think you're nuts, though.
p363
aa(lp364
Vgeorge
p365
aVall i know is i've been going to doctors all my life. what has it gotten me? i'm thirty-three years old. i haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, i'm already facing the problems of old age. i completely skipped healthy adulthood. i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. you could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. i've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
p366
aa(lp367
Vjerry
p368
aVi've never had a really good pickle.
p369
aa(lp370
Vgeorge
p371
aVbesides, what's it gonna cost me? thirty-eight bucks?
p372
aa(lp373
Vtor
p374
aVwould you not put your foot on that please?
p375
aa(lp376

p405
aa(lp406
Vtor
p407
aVkramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
p408
aa(lp409
Vgeorge
p410
aVyes, yes i am.
p411
aa(lp412
Vtor
p413
aVi think we can help you. see, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. and business needs customers. and, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
p414
aa(lp415
Vgeorge
p416
aVcan i use hot water on my face?
p417
aa(lp418
Vtor
p419
aVno. you know, i am not a business man. i'm a holistic healer. it's a calling, it's a gift. you see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. you see, that insures good business. you're not a patient. you're a customer.
p420
aa(lp421
Vjerry
p422
aVand you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
p423
aa(lp424

Vgeorge
p431
aVi guess so.
p432
aa(lp433
Vtor
p434
aVyou see, you are in disharmony. the throat is the gateway to the lung. tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.
p435
aa(lp436
Vjerry
p437
aVthere's some hot air blowing in here
p438
