aVthe phone message written by larry david & jerry seinfeld the bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you're doing. did you ever see anybody on tv like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? have you seen them? we have soda, we have soda, we have soda , jumping, laughing, flying through the air - it's a can of soda. have you ever been standing there and you're watching tv and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising right there on tv, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jetskiing, girls in bikinis and i'm standing there - maybe i'm putting too much ice in mine. so then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and i wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me i don't know what it means. sometimes i interpret it like they're psychotic or something and i don't know if i'm supposed to smile back, i don't know what to do. so i just stood there like - remember how quayle looked when benson gave him that kennedy line? - that's what i looked like.
p3
aa(lp4
Vjerry
p5
aVso you didn't ask?
p6
aa(lp7
Vgeorge
p8
aVno, i froze.
p9
aa(lp10
Vjerry
p11
aVcounter.
p12
aa(lp13
Vgeorge
p14
aVoh yeah. so wait, wait. a half-hour later i'm back in the office, i tell lloyd the whole story. he says so why don't you call her . i says i can't. i couldn't, i couldn't do it right then. for me to ask a woman out i gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. so lloyd calls me a wuss.
p15
aa(lp16
Vjerry
p17
aVhe said wuss?
p18
aa(lp19
Vgeorge
p20
aVyeah. anyway, he shamed me into it.
p21
aa(lp22
Vjerry
p23
aVso you called.
p24
aa(lp25
Vgeorge
p26
aVright. and, and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple, because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
p27
aa(lp28
Vjerry
p29
aVyeah, like a farm boy.
p30
aa(lp31
Vgeorge
p32
aVright. so i call her up, i tell her it's me, she gives me an enthusiastic 'hi!'
p33
aa(lp34
Vjerry
p35
aVwow. enthusiastic 'hi!', that's beautiful.
p36
aa(lp37
Vgeorge
p38
aVoh, i don't get the enthusiastic 'hi!', i'm outta there.
p39
aa(lp40
Vjerry
p41
aValright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic 'hi!' go ahead.
p42
aa(lp43
Vgeorge
p44
aVso, we're talking, and i don't like to go too long before i ask them out, i wanna get it over with right away, so i just blurt out what are you doing saturday night?
p45
aa(lp46
Vjerry
p47
aVand?
p48
aa(lp49
Vgeorge
p50
aVshe bought.
p51
aa(lp52
Vjerry
p53
aVgreat day in the morning.
p54
aa(lp55
Vgeorge
p56
aVthen i got off the phone right away.
p57
aa(lp58
Vjerry
p59
aVsure, it's like robbing a bank you don't loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. you come in, you hit and get out.
p60
aa(lp61
Vgeorge
p62
aVit's amazing we, we both have dates on the same night. i can't remember the last time that happened. george's car, parked outside apartment building, night. george and his date
p63
aa(lp64
Vcarol
p65
aV
p66
aa(lp67
Vgeorge
p68
aVi can't stand doing laundry. that's why i have forty pairs of underwear.
p69
aa(lp70
Vcarol
p71
aVyou do not.
p72
aa(lp73
Vgeorge
p74
aVabsolutely. because instead of doing a wash, i just keep buying underwear. my goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. that way, i only have to do wash once a year. jerry's car, also parked outside an apartment building. jerry and his girlfriend donna
p75
aa(lp76
Vjerry
p77
aVcome on, try it. let me hear you try a scottish accent.
p78
aa(lp79
Vdonna
p80
aVthat's irish.
p81
aa(lp82
Vjerry
p83
aVirish, scottish, what's the difference, lassie?
p84
aa(lp85
Vdonna
p86
aVso, er, thanks for dinner. it was great.
p87
aa(lp88
Vgeorge
p89
aVyeah. we should do this again.
p90
aa(lp91
Vdonna
p92
aVwould you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
p93
aa(lp94
Vgeorge
p95
aVoh, no, thanks. i can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
p96
aa(lp97
Vdonna
p98
aVso, um, ok.
p99
aa(lp100
Vgeorge
p101
aVok.
p102
aa(lp103
Vdonna
p104
aVgoodnight.
p105
aa(lp106
Vgeorge
p107
aVyeah, take it easy.
p108
aa(lp109
Vdonna
p110
aVthanks again for the movie.
p111
aa(lp112
Vjerry
p113
aVyou're welcome.
p114
aa(lp115
Vdonna
p116
aVi'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.
p117
aa(lp118
Vjerry
p119
aVoh, that's ok.
p120
aa(lp121
Vdonna
p122
aVunless you want to go to your place.
p123
aa(lp124
Vjerry
p125
aVok, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking for.
p126
aa(lp127
Vgeorge
p128
aVtake it easy, huh, take it easy.
p129
aa(lp130
Vjerry
p131
aVi think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note - it's common courtesy. i don't know, that's just the way i was brought up.
p132
aa(lp133
Vdonna
p134
aVvalues are very important.
p135
aa(lp136
Vjerry
p137
aVoh, so important. so what are you doing thursday night - you wanna have dinner?
p138
aa(lp139
Vdonna
p140
aVthursday's great.
p141
aa(lp142
Vjerry
p143
aVtan pants. why do i buy tan pants, donna? i don't feel comfortable in them.
p144
aa(lp145
Vdonna
p146
aVare those cotton dockers?
p147
aa(lp148
Vjerry
p149
aVoh, i can't begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial.
p150
aa(lp151
Vdonna
p152
aVreally? i like that commercial.
p153
aa(lp154
Vjerry
p155
aVyou like that commercial?
p156
aa(lp157
Vdonna
p158
aVyeah, it's clever.
p159
aa(lp160
Vjerry
p161
aVnow wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
p162
aa(lp163
Vdonna
p164
aVyeah, that's the one.
p165
aa(lp166
Vjerry
p167
aVwhat could you possibly like about that?
p168
aa(lp169
Vdonna
p170
aVi don't know, i like the guys.
p171
aa(lp172
Vjerry
p173
aVyeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and i could be comfortable too, if i had pants like that. i could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
p174
aa(lp175
Vdonna
p176
aVhey, i know guys like that. to me the dialogue rings true.
p177
aa(lp178
Vjerry
p179
aVeven if the dialogue did ring true. even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? doesn't that bother you?
p180
aa(lp181
Vdonna
p182
aVthat's the idea. that's what's clever about it, that they're not talking about the pants.
p183
aa(lp184
Vjerry
p185
aVbut they're talking about nothing.
p186
aa(lp187
Vdonna
p188
aVthat's the point.
p189
aa(lp190
Vjerry
p191
aVi know the point.
p192
aa(lp193
Vdonna
p194
aVno one is telling you to like it.
p195
aa(lp196
Vjerry
p197
aVi mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. what is that supposed to be? jerry monologue what's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. you know, like the guy'll be like 'i don't think her eyebrows are even. could i look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?' and of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'what is he looking at? do i want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?'
p198
aa(lp199
Vjerry
p200
aVi'm supposed to see her again on thursday, but can i go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
p201
aa(lp202
Velaine
p203
aVi once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean enough.
p204
aa(lp205
Vjerry
p206
aVno kidding. did you tell him that was the reason?
p207
aa(lp208
Velaine
p209
aVoh yeah, i told him all the time. you would not have believed his
p210
aa(lp211
Vtub
p212
aVgerms were building a town in there - they were constructing offices. houses near the drain were going for $150,000.
p213
aa(lp214
Velaine
p215
aVhi.
p216
aa(lp217
Vjerry
p218
aVyou're still thinking about this?
p219
aa(lp220
Vgeorge
p221
aVshe invites me up at twelve o clock at night, for coffee. and i don't go up. no thank you, i don't want coffee, it keeps me up. too late for me to drink coffee. i said this to her. people this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. i can't imagine what she must think of me.
p222
aa(lp223
Vjerry
p224
aVshe thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.
p225
aa(lp226
Vgeorge
p227
aVshe invited me up. coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.
p228
aa(lp229
Velaine
p230
aVmaybe coffee was coffee.
p231
aa(lp232
Vgeorge
p233
aVcoffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at night.
p234
aa(lp235
Velaine
p236
aVwell some people drink coffee that late.
p237
aa(lp238
Vgeorge
p239
aVyeah, people who work at norad, who're on twenty-four hour missile kept saying to myself keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great.
p240
aa(lp241
Velaine
p242
aVit's all in your head. all she knows is she had a good time. i think you should call her.
p243
aa(lp244
Vgeorge
p245
aVi can't call her now, it's too soon. i'm planning a wednesday call.
p246
aa(lp247
Velaine
p248
aVoh, why? i love it when guys call me the next day.
p249
aa(lp250
Vgeorge
p251
aVof course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes oh no, i don't drink coffee late at night. if i call her now, she's gonna think i'm too needy. women don't wanna see need. they want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a kaiser, a tsar.
p252
aa(lp253
Velaine
p254
aVall she'll think is that you like her.
p255
aa(lp256
Vgeorge
p257
aVyes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like me!
p258
aa(lp259
Velaine
p260
aVi don't know what your parents did to you.
p261
aa(lp262
Vkramer
p263
aVhey, i just thought of a really funny thing for your act. alright, you're up there, you're on the stage and you go hey, you ever notice how cars here in new york, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'well, sorry buddy, you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.' so you gonna use it?
p264
aa(lp265
Vjerry
p266
aVi don't think so.
p267
aa(lp268
Vkramer
p269
aVit's funny.
p270
aa(lp271
Velaine
p272
aVit is funny.
p273
aa(lp274
Vkramer
p275
aVthat's as good as anything you do.
p276
aa(lp277
Vgeorge
p278
aValright, i gotta make a call. everybody out, come on.
p279
aa(lp280
Vjerry
p281
aVwhy do we have to leave?
p282
aa(lp283
Vgeorge
p284
aVbecause i can't call a woman with other people in the room. come on, let's go.
p285
aa(lp286
Velaine
p287
aVoh, see, this is the problem.
p288
aa(lp289
Vjerry
p290
aVyou're kicking me out of my house?
p291
aa(lp292
Vgeorge
p293
aVyes.
p294
aa(lp295
Velaine
p296
aVdon't forget.
p297
aa(lp298
Vgeorge
p299
aVoh jerry, do you have any apples?
p300
aa(lp301
Vjerry
p302
aVdon't do the apples. that's enough already with the apples.
p303
aa(lp304
Vphone
p305
aVhi, it's carol, i 'll get back to you.
p306
aa(lp307
Vgeorge
p308
aVuhm, hi, it's george, george costanza, remember me? the guy that didn't come up for coffee. you see, i didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean well, whatever. anyway, it was fun. it was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so, you call me back. if you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. either way. the ball's in your court. so, er, take it easy.
p309
aa(lp310
Vjerry
p311
aVi'm just gonna get my jacket, i'll meet you downstairs. what's the matter, did you call?
p312
aa(lp313

p318
aa(lp319
Vgeorge
p320
aVi don't know what the hell i said. i gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing i can do. it's a machine. the little light is blinking right

p327
aa(lp328
Vgeorge
p329
aVnow i'm in the worst position of all.
p330
aa(lp331
Velaine
p332
aVy'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
p333
aa(lp334
Vgeorge
p335
aVhe did that?
p336
aa(lp337
Velaine
p338
aVyeah.

aVsomebody did that?
