V  THE DOG  Written by Larry David     (Comedy club)   So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some   time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up   time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when   they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the   aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as   fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it   some gas! We're flying!   New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated)   man.   Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I   was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had   just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel   without him.  
p2
tp3
a(V JERRY 
p4
V Is he on the plane now?  
p5
tp6
a(V GAVIN 
p7
V Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't   know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than   most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?   
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Uh, just my next door neighbor.  
p11
tp12
a(V GAVIN 
p13
V You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways    that you never could have thought possible.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?    Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V What's the matter?  
p20
tp21
a(V GAVIN 
p22
V Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.   Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where   flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.     ATTENDANT #1  Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you   to a hospital.  
p23
tp24
a(V GAVIN 
p25
V My dog. What about my dog?   ATTENDANT #1  Uh, you have a dog?   ATTENDANT #2  Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?    Jerry stares out the window.  
p26
tp27
a(V GAVIN 
p28
V Jerry?  
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Huh? How you feeling?  
p32
tp33
a(V GAVIN 
p34
V Would you take care of Farfel?  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V Farfel?   ATTENDANT #2  It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital,   could you take his dog to New York?  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V The dog? The dog??  
p41
tp42
a(V GAVIN 
p43
V I'm sure it's only for a day or two.    
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V But, you know, what if, you know?  
p47
tp48
a(V GAVIN 
p49
V Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.   
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V The dog?   New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a   loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing   'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.    
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid   idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?  
p56
tp57
a(V ELAINE 
p58
V Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.   
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this?   Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house!   He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.  
p62
tp63
a(V ELAINE 
p64
V If only.  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house   at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of   the house since I got back.  
p68
tp69
a(V ELAINE 
p70
V Hey, when you walk him, do ya...  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Do I what?  
p74
tp75
a(V ELAINE 
p76
V Do you pick it up?  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V Yes, I pick it up.  
p80
tp81
a(V ELAINE 
p82
V You pick it up?!?  
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V Well you have to.  
p86
tp87
a(V ELAINE 
p88
V Oh, boy would I love to see that.  
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to   do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?   
p92
tp93
a(V ELAINE 
p94
V Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg   creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V No, milk.  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.   
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE 
p106
V What is a bender anyhow?  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.   
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINE 
p112
V I can't believe he hasn't called.  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his    dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!   Kramer enters.  
p116
tp117
a(V KRAMER 
p118
V Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.    
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Why?  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.   
p125
tp126
a(V KRAMER 
p127
V I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V You're breaking up?  
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You   know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their   feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,   watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.  
p134
tp135
a(V ELAINE 
p136
V Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.   
p137
tp138
a(V KRAMER 
p139
V Woah, you didn't like her?  
p140
tp141
a(V ELAINE 
p142
V If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant    Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.   
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.   
p146
tp147
a(V KRAMER 
p148
V How come you never said anything?  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after    they stop seeing them.  
p152
tp153
a(V KRAMER 
p154
V I tell you.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V You. I'm talking about people.  
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE

V Just me and George?  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V Sure.  
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V But we need you.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V What do you need me for?   Jerry's buzzer buzzes.  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Because... Yeah?  
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V Prognosis Negative!   Elaine buzzes George into the building.  
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law.   Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just   put some newspapers down or something?  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's   right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V Just me and George alone?   George enters.  
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha   ha!!!  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V I can't go.  
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V Can't go, Why not?  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.    
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V I thought Kramer was watching.  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V No, I don't want that smell in the house.    
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V You spritz a little Lysol on it.  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of   strange mutant funk.  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V So we're not going?  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Nah. You two go.  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Oh. You still wanna go?  
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Do you?  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V If you want.  
p236
tp237
a(V ELAINE 
p238
V It's up to you.  
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V Go ahead.  
p242
tp243
a(V ELAINE 
p244
V Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,   you wanna see Ponce de Leon?  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?   
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V I want to but I can't.  
p251
tp252
a(V ELAINE 
p253
V Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean   everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can   switch apartments for the night.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V No.  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V What about this--  
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.   
p263
tp264
a(V ELAINE 
p265
V I know, it's not that.  
p266
tp267
a(V GEORGE 
p268
V It's just we want you to go.  
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!    On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking   along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of   human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think   the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a   poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?    New scene. George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're   obviously uncomfortable alone together.  
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V So how long did you live there?  
p275
tp276
a(V ELAINE 
p277
V About three years.  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V That's pretty long.  
p281
tp282
a(V ELAINE 
p283
V Hmm.  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V It's not that long, really.  
p287
tp288
a(V ELAINE 
p289
V Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same   time, then stop. Another silence.  
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V And then you came here.  
p293
tp294
a(V ELAINE 
p295
V Yeah. So I've been here about six years.    
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,    eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.   New scene. Jerry vs. Farfel, part II  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from   me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!    New scene. Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.  
p302
tp303
a(V KRAMER 
p304
V I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do   something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to   society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you?   Couldn't respect myself.     New scene. Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before.  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V I like herbal tea.   Elaine yawns.  
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.   
p311
tp312
a(V ELAINE 
p313
V Jerry likes Morning Thunder.  
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?  
p317
tp318
a(V ELAINE 
p319
V Yeah.  
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.   
p323
tp324
a(V ELAINE 
p325
V Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.   
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V You don't tell him?  
p329
tp330
a(V ELAINE 
p331
V No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he   doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel   great!"  
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V You don't tell him?  
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V No.  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V That is so funny!  
p341
tp342
a(V ELAINE 
p343
V I know!  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!     They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more   laughter.   New scene. Kramer has had a change of heart.  
p347
tp348
a(V KRAMER 
p349
V Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,   every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do   anything!   New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on   Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable.   Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel!   Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're   checking out!   New scene. Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment.  
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many   situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.    
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.   
p359
tp360
a(V ELAINE 
p361
V The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of   you.   Jerry (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how   soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the   movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay,   see you in five minutes.   Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing.  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on   down. (To Elaine) What?  
p365
tp366
a(V ELAINE 
p367
V Do you have to?  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not   sure this is a dog.  
p371
tp372
a(V ELAINE 
p373
V You know, the guy might have just lost your number.   
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V I'm in the book and I have a machine.    
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them   there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.    
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Really? How late are they open?   Kramer enters.  
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V What?  
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V What is it?  
p389
tp390
a(V KRAMER 
p391
V I went back with Ellen.  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p394
V Ohhhhh, that's great.  
p395
tp396
a(V ELAINE 
p397
V Terrific.  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.   
p401
tp402
a(V ELAINE 
p403
V Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.   
p404
tp405
a(V KRAMER 
p406
V Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?   
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.   
p410
tp411
a(V KRAMER 
p412
V From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you    don't know me.  
p413
tp414
a(V ELAINE 
p415
V Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V What are you doing?  
p419
tp420
a(V KRAMER 
p421
V I'm getting my pot.   Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.  
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V Kramer, we like her.  
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?    
p428
tp429
a(V ELAINE 
p430
V I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.   
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said   anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer)   Yeah?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Prognosis Negative!   Farfel begins barking.  
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.  
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.   
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the   movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.  
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?   
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V We'll see it Sunday.   George enters.  
p455
tp456
a(V GEORGE 
p457
V Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?   
p458
tp459
a(V ELAINE 
p460
V I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.    
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V What does this mean?  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De   Leon.  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.   
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go   to the bathroom.  
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475

p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V I don't know, regular human time?  
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?   
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Why shouldn't I go here?  
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure   you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.  
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V And isn't it more fun using the urinal?    
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V Yeah.  
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!    
p497
tp498
a(V GEORGE 
p499
V Hey, go.  
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Who's stopping you?  
p503
tp504
a(V GEORGE 
p505
V What, are you doing me a favor?  
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V Like we care if you go to the bathroom.     Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.    
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V How's it going?  
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V Good. Good. You?  
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Things are good.   After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and   squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.  
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Boy, he takes such a long time.  
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V I know.  
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V You know what he does in there? He gargles.    
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?   
p530
tp531
a(V ELAINE 
p532
V Yeah, he does it like six times a day.    
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V How come we never hear him?  
p536
tp537
a(V ELAINE 
p538
V Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,   watch.   Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.    
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!   
p542
tp543
a(V ELAINE 
p544
V We talked about that already.  
p545
tp546

p547
V Oh.   New scene. Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.  
p548
tp549
a(V GEORGE 
p550
V I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm   out of conversation.  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V So what are calling me six times a day?    
p554
tp555
a(V GEORGE 
p556
V All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,   I could always read the sports section.  
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.   
p560
tp561
a(V GEORGE 
p562
V Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.    
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?   
p566
tp567
a(V GEORGE 
p568
V Nothing except Prognosis Negative.    
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.    New scene. Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.  
p572
tp573
a(V ELAINE 
p574
V Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with!   When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!     The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.  
p575
tp576
a(V ELAINE 
p577
V Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my   god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your   dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.   Cut back to Jerry and George.  
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but   it's this or nothing.  
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V I don't know what to do.  
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.   
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V I know, I know.  
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.   
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V It is kind of silly.  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V Of course it is.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.   
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V Exactly.  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V It's not like she's *in* the movie.    
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Right.  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I   mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these   circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.    
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.   
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level    of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,   let's just go.  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V Good.  
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V Saving movies.

tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V Ridiculous!  
p629

V Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.    
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V Oh, you're dead.   New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is   barking as loud as ever.  
p635
tp636
a(V GAVIN 
p637
V Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed.   Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely   incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!  
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said    you were released on Monday.  
p641
tp642
a(V GAVIN 
p643
V Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center   in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians.   
p644
tp645
a(V KRAMER 
p646
V Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!  
p647
tp648

p649
V He won't hurt you, he's just playing.    
p650
tp651
a(V KRAMER 
p652
V Hey you keep that mutt away from me.    
p653
tp654
a(V GAVIN 
p655
V Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.   
p656
tp657
a(V ELLEN 
p658
V Kramer, are you coming?  
p659
tp660

p661
V Oh, hi Ellen.  
p662
tp663
a(V ELLEN 
p664
V Get in here.   Kramer sulks off.  
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,    but if you don't mind...  
p668
tp669
a(V GAVIN 
p670
V Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit   him before the month is out.  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.    Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's   apartment.   New scene. Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676

p679
V Why don't we just rent a movie?  
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.   
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,   there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard.  
p686
tp687
a(V ELAINE 
p688
V Jerry, you promised me we'd go.  
p689
tp690
a(V JERRY 
p691
V Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost   feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.  
p692
tp693
a(V ELAINE 
p694
V Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.   
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V You and George got together?  
p698
tp699
a(V ELAINE 
p700
V Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.    Kramer enters.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V Hello.   Kramer, Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.  
p704
tp705

V What's up?  
p707
tp708

p709
V Well, you were right.

V Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.   
p716

a(V ELAINE 
p721
V I thought she was the one.  
p722
tp723
a(V KRAMER 
p724
V I'll bring back the pot.  
p725
tp726

V Okay, c'mon it's movie time.  
p728
