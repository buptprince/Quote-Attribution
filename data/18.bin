V  THE TRUTH  Written by Elaine Pope & Larry Charles     (Comedy club)     Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too, that's the other thing ...       (Monk's)     Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant     now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats

V A mental institution.   STAND UP ROUTINE      Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have    clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments that people like    to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good    (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're    naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's    nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I    feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and    lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be,    wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand    in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.   =    Jerry's Apartment
