aVthe deal written by larry david i've been watching women in the department stores. they're trying on clothes, and i've noticed that they do it differently from men. women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? they take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. they can tell something from this. they stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day i'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am i gonna wear? you never see a man do that. you never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, what do you think about this suit? i think i'll get it. yeah, it looks fine. put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, i wanna make sure. yeah, perfect. and what if i'm walking? move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.

aa(lp4
Vjerry

aVwhat are you doing? all right, all right. what's the matter with that? what about that one?
p6
aa(lp7
Velaine

aa(lp10
Vjerry

aVhe was good in man from uncle.

p15
aa(lp16
Vjerry
p17
aVi know, i'm having my root canal the same week.
p18
aa(lp19
Velaine
p20
aVoh, right. i hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. hey, look at naked people.
p21
aa(lp22
Vjerry
p23
aVno, i don't wanna see the naked people.
p24
aa(lp25
Velaine
p26
aVbeen a while?
p27
aa(lp28
Vjerry
p29
aVi have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
p30
aa(lp31
Velaine
p32
aVi think my last time was in rochester. my hair was a lot shorter.
p33
aa(lp34
Vjerry
p35
aVi remember that it's a good thing. someday, i hope to do it again.
p36
aa(lp37
Velaine
p38
aVwhat?
p39
aa(lp40
Vjerry
p41
aVwhat?
p42
aa(lp43
Velaine
p44
aVwhat was that look?
p45
aa(lp46
Vjerry
p47
aVwhat look?
p48
aa(lp49
Velaine
p50
aVthe look you just gave me.
p51
aa(lp52
Vjerry
p53
aVi gave a look?
p54
aa(lp55
Velaine
p56
aVyes.
p57
aa(lp58
Vjerry
p59
aVwhat kind of look?
p60
aa(lp61
Velaine
p62
aVi know that look.
p63
aa(lp64
Vjerry
p65
aVthen what was it?
p66
aa(lp67
Velaine
p68
aVwhy should i tell you?
p69
aa(lp70
Vjerry
p71
aVwell, you're the big look expert. i wanna see how smart you are.
p72
aa(lp73
Velaine
p74
aVtrust me. i know the look. so
p75
aa(lp76
Vjerry
p77
aVwhat?
p78
aa(lp79
Velaine
p80
aVwhat about the look?
p81
aa(lp82
Vjerry
p83
aVi don't know.
p84
aa(lp85
Velaine
p86
aVyou got something on your mind?
p87
aa(lp88
Vjerry
p89
aVno. things pop into your head. you?
p90
aa(lp91
Velaine
p92
aVthings occur to me from time to time.
p93
aa(lp94
Vjerry
p95
aVyeah, me too. well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
p96
aa(lp97
Velaine
p98
aVno, of course not.
p99
aa(lp100
Vjerry
p101
aVi mean, it was something we did. probably about, what? twenty-five times?
p102
aa(lp103
Velaine
p104
aVthirty-seven.
p105
aa(lp106
Vjerry
p107
aVyeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there.
p108
aa(lp109
Velaine
p110
aVwe know the terrain.
p111
aa(lp112
Vjerry
p113
aVno big surprises.
p114
aa(lp115
Velaine
p116
aVnope.
p117
aa(lp118
Vjerry
p119
aVwhat do you think?
p120
aa(lp121
Velaine
p122
aVi don't know. what do you think?
p123
aa(lp124
Vjerry
p125
aVwell, it's something to consider.
p126
aa(lp127
Velaine
p128
aVyeah.
p129
aa(lp130
Vjerry
p131
aVi mean, let's say we did.
p132
aa(lp133
Velaine
p134
aVwhat if.
p135
aa(lp136
Vjerry
p137
aVis that like the end of the world or something?
p138
aa(lp139
Velaine
p140
aVcertainly not.
p141
aa(lp142
Vjerry
p143
aVwhy shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
p144
aa(lp145
Velaine
p146
aVi know.
p147
aa(lp148
Vjerry
p149
aVi mean, really, what is the big deal? we go in there. we're in there for a while. we come right back out here. it's not complicated.
p150
aa(lp151
Velaine
p152
aVit's almost stupid if we didn't.
p153
aa(lp154
Vjerry
p155
aVit's moronic.
p156
aa(lp157
Velaine
p158
aVabsurd!
p159
aa(lp160
Vjerry
p161
aVof course, i guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
p162
aa(lp163
Velaine
p164
aVwe, there are always a few.
p165
aa(lp166
Vjerry
p167
aVi mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
p168
aa(lp169
Velaine
p170
aVdevastating.
p171
aa(lp172
Vjerry
p173
aVbecause this is very good.
p174
aa(lp175
Velaine
p176
aVand that would be good.
p177
aa(lp178
Vjerry
p179
aVthat would be good too. the idea is combine the this and the that. but this cannot be disturbed.
p180
aa(lp181
Velaine
p182
aVyeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
p183
aa(lp184
Vjerry
p185
aVbut of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. maybe some rules or something.
p186
aa(lp187
Velaine
p188
aVhuh.
p189
aa(lp190
Vjerry
p191
aVfor example, now, i call you whenever i'm inclined and vice versa.
p192
aa(lp193
Velaine
p194
aVright.
p195
aa(lp196
Vjerry
p197
aVbut if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
p198
aa(lp199
Velaine
p200
aVwell why should that be? oh, i have an idea. i have an idea. no call the day after that.
p201
aa(lp202
Vjerry
p203
aVbeautiful. let's make it a rule.
p204
aa(lp205
Velaine
p206
aVall right, sir.
p207
aa(lp208
Vjerry
p209
aVnow here's another little rule. when we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. but sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. when that is not really sleep. sleep is separate from that. and i don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
p210
aa(lp211
Velaine
p212
aVokay, okay. spending the night is optional!
p213
aa(lp214
Vjerry
p215
aVwell now we're gettin' somewhere.
p216
aa(lp217
Velaine
p218
aVwhat about the kiss goodnight?
p219
aa(lp220
Vjerry
p221
aVtough one. you're call.
p222
aa(lp223
Velaine
p224
aVit's brug-wa.
p225
aa(lp226
Vjerry
p227
aVfine. well.
p228
aa(lp229
Velaine
p230
aVwell.
p231
aa(lp232
Vjerry
p233
aVyou ready?
p234
aa(lp235
Velaine
p236
aVready.
p237
aa(lp238
Vjerry
p239
aVso think you can handle this?
p240
aa(lp241
Velaine
p242
aVdefinitely.
p243
aa(lp244
Vkramer
p245
aVhey.
p246
aa(lp247
Vjerry
p248
aVhey.
p249
aa(lp250
Vkramer
p251
aVgot the paper?
p252
aa(lp253
Vjerry
p254
aVnot yet.
p255
aa(lp256
Vkramer
p257
aVno paper?
p258
aa(lp259
Vjerry
p260
aVi haven't been out yet.
p261
aa(lp262
Vkramer
p263
aVwell, what's taking you so long? uh? oh, well, yeah
p264
aa(lp265
Vgeorge
p266
aVwhat's the deal with aquaman? could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
p267
aa(lp268
Vjerry
p269
aVno, i think i saw him on land a couple times. so how's the job situation goin'?
p270
aa(lp271
Vgeorge
p272
aVstill lookin'. it's pretty bad out there. what about you?
p273
aa(lp274
Vjerry
p275
aVnothin' much. i slept with elaine last night.
p276
aa(lp277
Vgeorge
p278
aVoxygen! i need some oxygen! this is major.
p279
aa(lp280
Vjerry
p281
aVi thought you'd like that.
p282
aa(lp283
Vgeorge
p284
aVoh, this is huge!
p285
aa(lp286
Vjerry
p287
aVi know.
p288
aa(lp289
Vgeorge
p290
aVall right, okay. let's go, details.
p291
aa(lp292
Vjerry
p293
aVno, i can't do details.
p294
aa(lp295
Vgeorge
p296
aVyou wha?
p297
aa(lp298
Vjerry
p299
aVi can't give details.
p300
aa(lp301
Vgeorge
p302
aVno details?
p303
aa(lp304
Vjerry
p305
aVi'm not in the mood.
p306
aa(lp307
Vgeorge
p308
aVyou ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. now you listen to me. i want details and i want them right now. i don't have a job, i have no place to go. you're not in the mood? well you get in the mood!
p309
aa(lp310
Vjerry
p311
aVall right, okay. we're in the apartment watching tv.
p312
aa(lp313
Vgeorge
p314
aVwhere are you sitting?
p315
aa(lp316
Vjerry
p317
aVon the couch.
p318
aa(lp319
Vgeorge
p320
aVnext to each other?
p321
aa(lp322
Vjerry
p323
aVno, separated.
p324
aa(lp325
Vgeorge
p326
aVtime?
p327
aa(lp328
Vjerry
p329
aVabout eleven.
p330
aa(lp331
Vgeorge
p332
aVokay, go ahead.
p333
aa(lp334
Vjerry
p335
aVso she's flipping around the tv, and she gets to the naked station.
p336
aa(lp337
Vgeorge
p338
aVoh, see? that's why i don't have cable in my house. because of that naked station. if i had that in my house, i would never turn it off. i wouldn't sleep, i wouldn't eat. eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. all right, all right. so you're watching the naked station.
p339
aa(lp340
Vjerry
p341
aVand then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
p342
aa(lp343
Vgeorge
p344
aVboy, these are really bad details.
p345
aa(lp346
Vjerry
p347
aVit pains me to say this, but i may be getting to mature for details.
p348
aa(lp349
Vgeorge
p350
aVoh i hate to hear this. that kind of growth really irritates me.
p351
aa(lp352
Vjerry
p353
aVwell. i'll tell you though. it was really passionate.
p354
aa(lp355
Vgeorge
p356
aVbetter than before?
p357
aa(lp358
Vjerry
p359
aVshe must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
p360
aa(lp361
Vgeorge
p362
aVthis is all too much. so what are you feeling? what's going on? are you like a couple again now?
p363
aa(lp364
Vjerry
p365
aVnot exactly.
p366
aa(lp367
Vgeorge
p368
aVnot exactly. what does that mean?
p369
aa(lp370
Vjerry
p371
aVwell, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends.
p372
aa(lp373
Vgeorge
p374
aVwhere are you living? are you here? are you on this planet? it's impossible. it can't be done. thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. so all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. where do you get the ego? no one can do it. it can't be done.
p375
aa(lp376
Vjerry
p377
aVi think we've worked out a system.
p378
aa(lp379
Vgeorge
p380
aVoh, you know what you're like? you're like a pathetic gambler. you're one of those losers in las vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
p381
aa(lp382
Vjerry
p383
aVno, this is very advanced. we've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.
p384
aa(lp385
Vgeorge
p386
aVsure, all right. tell me the rules.
p387
aa(lp388
Vjerry
p389
aVokay. no calls the next day.
p390
aa(lp391
Vgeorge
p392
aVso you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. that's pretty good. go ahead.
p393
aa(lp394
Vjerry
p395
aVyou ready for the second one?
p396
aa(lp397
Vgeorge
p398
aVi have tell you, i'm pretty impressed with the first one.
p399
aa(lp400
Vjerry
p401
aVspending the night. optional.
p402
aa(lp403
Vgeorge
p404
aVno, you see? you got greedy.
p405
aa(lp406
Vjerry
p407
aVno, that's the rule. it's optional.
p408
aa(lp409
Vgeorge
p410
aVi know less about women than anyone in the world. but one thing i do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. i could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide you're not going anywhere.
p411
aa(lp412
Vjerry
p413
aVi think you're wrong.
p414
aa(lp415
Vgeorge
p416
aVi hope i am.
p417
aa(lp418
Vjerry
p419
aVis this yours or the roommate's?
p420
aa(lp421
Velaine
p422
aVthe roommate's.
p423
aa(lp424
Vjerry
p425
aVwould she mind?
p426
aa(lp427
Velaine
p428
aVshe keeps track of everything.
p429
aa(lp430
Vjerry
p431
aVwell, that's too bad, 'cause i'm takin' it.
p432
aa(lp433
Velaine
p434
aVthanks.
p435
aa(lp436
Vjerry
p437
aVwell, guess i'll get going.
p438
aa(lp439
Velaine
p440
aVoh.
p441
aa(lp442
Vjerry
p443
aVwell, i have that root canal tomorrow morning. it'll be easier if i go home.
p444
aa(lp445
Velaine
p446
aVfine, go away.
p447
aa(lp448
Vjerry
p449
aVi don't understand. is there a problem? i'm getting the impression there's a problem.
p450
aa(lp451
Velaine
p452
aVjust go.
p453
aa(lp454
Vjerry
p455
aVi'm having surgery tomorrow.
p456
aa(lp457
Velaine
p458
aVoh, surgery. you're going to the dentist.
p459
aa(lp460
Vjerry
p461
aVbut you said, it can be very serious.
p462
aa(lp463
Velaine
p464
aVokay, so fine. go.
p465
aa(lp466
Vjerry
p467
aVwhat happened to the rules? remember? sleeping over was optional.
p468
aa(lp469
Velaine
p470
aVyeah, it's my house, it's my option.
p471
aa(lp472
Vjerry
p473
aVit has nothing to do with whose house it is.
p474
aa(lp475
Velaine
p476
aVoh, of course it does.
p477
aa(lp478
Vtina
p479
aVhi. elaine + jerry hi.
p480
aa(lp481
Vtina
p482
aVhi, jerry.
p483
aa(lp484
Vjerry
p485
aVhi.
p486
aa(lp487
Vtina
p488
aVsuch a great improv class tonight.
p489
aa(lp490
Velaine
p491
aVoh really?
p492
aa(lp493
Vtina
p494
aVi had this improv where i pretended i was working in one of those booths. you know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.
p495
aa(lp496
Velaine
p497
aVuh, tina? could you excuse us for just one second?
p498
aa(lp499
Vtina
p500
aVoh, yeah. i'll excuse you.
p501
aa(lp502
Velaine
p503
aVwhat are you doing?
p504
aa(lp505
Vjerry
p506
aVi can't go if you're mad.
p507
aa(lp508
Velaine
p509
aVi'm not mad.
p510
aa(lp511
Vjerry
p512
aVyou seemed a little mad.
p513
aa(lp514
Velaine
p515
aVno, no. jerry, i'm fine really. it's okay.
p516
aa(lp517
Vjerry
p518
aVso you're okay with everything?
p519
aa(lp520
Velaine
p521
aVdefinitely. are you?
p522
aa(lp523
Vjerry
p524
aVdefinitely. well, goodnight.
p525
aa(lp526
Velaine

aVwhat about jewelry? that's very nice gift.
p540
aa(lp541
Vjerry
p542
aVno, no. i have to be very careful here. i don't want to send the wrong message. especially after the other night.
p543
aa(lp544
Vgeorge
p545
aVmaybe i'll get her some jewelry.
p546
aa(lp547
Vjerry
p548
aVno, no. you can't get her anything better than me. whatever i spend, you have to spend half.
p549
aa(lp550
Vgeorge
p551
aVwhat am i supposed to get, a bazooka?
p552
aa(lp553
Vjerry
p554
aVyou don't understand. i'm in a very delicate position. whatever i give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
p555
aa(lp556
Vgeorge
p557
aVwhat does she need? maybe there's something that she needs.
p558
aa(lp559
Vjerry
p560
aVi think i heard her say something about a bench.
p561
aa(lp562
Vgeorge
p563
aVa bench? what kind of a bench?
p564
aa(lp565
Vjerry
p566
aVi don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
p567
aa(lp568
Vgeorge
p569
aVwhat, like at a bus stop?
p570
aa(lp571
Vjerry
p572
aVi don't know.
p573
aa(lp574
Vgeorge
p575
aVlike a park bench?
p576
aa(lp577
Vjerry

p588
aa(lp589
Vjerry
p590
aVno, too relationshippy. she opens it up, she hears that laura's theme, i'm dead.
p591
aa(lp592
Vgeorge
p593
aVokay, what about a nice frame? with a picture of another guy in it. frame says i care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
p594
aa(lp595
Vjerry
p596
aVnice looking fellow.
p597
aa(lp598
Vgeorge
p599
aVwhat about candle holders?
p600
aa(lp601
Vjerry
p602
aVtoo romantic.
p603

aa(lp763
Vjerry

aVwell
p777
aa(lp778
Vgeorge
p779
aVthose birthdays. i told you. they're relationship killers. if a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
p780
aa(lp781
Vjerry
p782
aVi never should have made up those rules.
p783
aa(lp784
Vgeorge
p785
aVwhat is it about sex that just disrupts everything? is it the touching? is it the nudity?
p786
aa(lp787
Vjerry
p788
aVit can't be the nudity. i never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when i was changing before gym class.
p789
aa(lp790
Vgeorge
p791
aVyou know what this means? i can't see her anymore either.
p792
aa(lp793
Vjerry
p794
aVwhy?
p795
aa(lp796
Vgeorge
p797
aVit's break up by association. besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
p798
aa(lp799
Vjerry
p800
aVwhat did you end up giving her?
p801
aa(lp802
Vgeorge

aa(lp808
Vgeorge
p809
aVso what're you gonna do?
p810
aa(lp811
Vjerry
p812
aVwell, if i call her, there's no joking around anymore. this is pretty much it.
p813
aa(lp814
Vgeorge
p815
aVso, maybe this should be it.
p816
aa(lp817
Vjerry
p818
aVcould be it.
p819
aa(lp820
Vgeorge
p821
aVshe seems like an it.
p822
aa(lp823
Vjerry
p824
aVshe's at it as you get. imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. and she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in vermont
p825
aa(lp826
Vgeorge
p827
aVwe'd have to kill him.
p828
aa(lp829
Vjerry
p830
aVwe'd get caught, i'd get the chair.
p831
aa(lp832
Vgeorge
p833
aVi'd go to prison as your accomplice. i'd have to wear that really heavy denim. go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
p834
aa(lp835
Vjerry
p836
aVplus, you know what else.
