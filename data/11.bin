aV  THE REVENGE  Written by Larry David     Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get    this...I got it all on video. (laughing)

V GEORGE 
p5
aV That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.    Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.     (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You    are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at    you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking    object over on desk) I quit!

aV Hey.  
p12
aa(lp13
V KRAMER 
p14
aV Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last    night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the    roof to kill himself.  
p15
aa(lp16
V JERRY 
p17
aV Well, what'd you say?  
p18
aa(lp19
V KRAMER 
p20
aV I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I    said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop    bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.   
p21
aa(lp22
V JERRY 
p23
aV What's his problem?  
p24
aa(lp25
V KRAMER 
p26
aV No job. No women.  
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV He called the right guy.  
p30
aa(lp31
V KRAMER 
p32
aV What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live    for? Why should I lie to him?  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.   
p36
aa(lp37
V KRAMER 
p38
aV Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?   
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV Fluff and fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with    words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.  
p42
aa(lp43
V KRAMER 
p44
aV How 'bout if I put a few things --    
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --  
p48
aa(lp49
V KRAMER 
p50
aV Well, you're going over there.  
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You    can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a    riot.  
p54
aa(lp55
V KRAMER 
p56
aV Have you ever met my guys?  
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY

aV Ah!    
p69
aa(lp70
V JERRY 
p71
aV Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done    in a separate machine?  
p72
aa(lp73
V VIC 
p74
aV I'll have to charge you for another machine.   
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are    not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump    across.  
p78
aa(lp79
V GEORGE 
p80
aV Guess what.  
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV How did you know I was here?

aV I quit my job.

aV I couldn't take it anymore.

aa(lp103
V JERRY 
p104
aV What happened? Levitan?  
p105
aa(lp106
V GEORGE 
p107
aV I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I    get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall.    Well, (laughing) we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!    
p108
aa(lp109
V JERRY 
p110
aV You and your toilets.  
p111
aa(lp112
V GEORGE 
p113
aV I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)    
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else    in real estate?  
p117
aa(lp118
V GEORGE 
p119
aV Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.    
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV So what are you gonna do?  
p123
aa(lp124
V GEORGE 
p125
aV I like sports. I could do something in sports.   
p126
aa(lp127
V JERRY 
p128
aV Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?  
p129
aa(lp130
V GEORGE 
p131
aV You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.   
p132
aa(lp133
V JERRY 
p134
aV Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.   
p135
aa(lp136
V GEORGE 
p137
aV Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could    be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make    those interesting comments during the game.  
p138
aa(lp139
V JERRY 
p140
aV Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.    
p141
aa(lp142
V GEORGE 
p143
aV What about that?  
p144
aa(lp145
V JERRY 
p146
aV Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that    are, you know, in broadcasting.  
p147
aa(lp148
V GEORGE 
p149
aV Well, that's really not fair.  
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?   
p153
aa(lp154
V GEORGE 
p155
aV Movies. I like to watch movies.  
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV Yeah. Yeah.  
p159
aa(lp160
V GEORGE 
p161
aV Do they pay people to watch movies?    
p162
aa(lp163
V JERRY 
p164
aV Projectionists.  
p165
aa(lp166
V GEORGE 
p167
aV That's true.  
p168
aa(lp169
V JERRY 
p170
aV But you gotta know how to work the projector.    
p171
aa(lp172
V GEORGE 
p173
aV Right.  
p174
aa(lp175
V JERRY 
p176
aV And it's probably a union thing.  
p177
aa(lp178
V GEORGE 
p179
aV (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a    talk show host?  
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV Talk show host. That's good.  
p183
aa(lp184
V GEORGE 
p185
aV I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone    even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.    
p186
aa(lp187
V JERRY 
p188
aV Really?  
p189
aa(lp190
V GEORGE 
p191
aV Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you    start?  
p192
aa(lp193
V JERRY 
p194
aV Well, that's where it gets tricky.    
p195
aa(lp196
V GEORGE 
p197
aV You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk    show host."  
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV I wouldn't think so.  
p201
aa(lp202
V GEORGE 
p203
aV It's all politics.  
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY 
p206
aV All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?   
p207
aa(lp208
V GEORGE 
p209
aV This could have been a huge mistake.    
p210
aa(lp211
V JERRY 
p212
aV Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.   
p213
aa(lp214
V GEORGE 
p215
aV (sighs) What should I do?  
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV Maybe you can just go back.  
p219
aa(lp220
V GEORGE 
p221
aV Go back?  
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY

V GEORGE 
p227
aV You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it    never happened?  
p228
aa(lp229
V JERRY 
p230
aV Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.   
p231
aa(lp232
V GEORGE 
p233
aV Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.   
p234
aa(lp235
V JERRY 
p236
aV Never happened.  
p237
aa(lp238
V GEORGE 
p239
aV I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?   
p240
aa(lp241
V JERRY 
p242
aV So what? You're entitled.  
p243
aa(lp244
V GEORGE 
p245
aV I'm emotional.  
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV That's right. You're emotional.  
p249
aa(lp250

V LEVITAN 
p329
aV Okay. I want you outta here.  
p330
aa(lp331
V GEORGE 
p332
aV I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious    aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see?  
p333
aa(lp334
V LEVITAN 
p335
aV You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're    there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll     always be a loser.  
p336
aa(lp337
V GEORGE 
p338
aV " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is    what he said to me.

p372
aa(lp373
V GEORGE 
p374
aV You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been    looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole    thing.  
p375

aV What if you destroy him?  
p378
aa(lp379
V GEORGE 
p380
aV No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched    it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.

aV Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.    
p384

V JERRY 
p425

V JERRY 
p461
aV Whew. Did he wave?  
p462
aa(lp463

p464
aV No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from    across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to    get back at me.  
p465
aa(lp466
V JERRY 
p467

p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some    reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely     forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on,    let's go.  
p474
aa(lp475

V VIC 
p488
aV Hey, you see that sign right there?    
p489
aa(lp490
V JERRY

aV Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?   
p492
aa(lp493
V VIC 
p494
aV I'm not responsible.  
p495
aa(lp496
V JERRY 
p497
aV So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a    license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?  
p498

p501
aa(lp502

aV First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.   
p531
aa(lp532
V ELAINE

p536
aV That's exactly what I told Jerry!  
p537

V GEORGE 
p545
aV God, I've never felt so alive!  
p546
aa(lp547
V JERRY 
p548
aV Maybe we should call this off.  
p549
aa(lp550
V KRAMER 
p551
aV Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in    the washing machine.  
p552
aa(lp553
V JERRY 
p554
aV And what's gonna happen?  
p555
aa(lp556
V KRAMER 
p557
aV Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the    cycle it'll be a solid block!  
p558
aa(lp559
V JERRY 
p560
aV If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like    Lex Luthor.  
p561
aa(lp562
V KRAMER 
p563
aV You keep him busy.   (Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine,     knocking chairs around)   (Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine)  
p564
aa(lp565
V KRAMER 
p566
aV Whoa!   (lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards    and slams into dryer)  
p567
aa(lp568
V GEORGE 
p569
aV You go over there -  
p570
aa(lp571
V ELAINE 
p572
aV Yeah.  
p573
aa(lp574
V GEORGE 
p575
aV You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're    keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.  
p576
aa(lp577
V ELAINE 
p578
aV Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?   
p579
aa(lp580
V LEVITAN 
p581
aV Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.   
p582
aa(lp583
V ELAINE 
p584
aV Oops! 'Scuse me.  
p585
aa(lp586
V LEVITAN 
p587
aV Yeah.  
p588
aa(lp589
V GREENY 
p590
aV I'm gonna get some food. You want some?    
p591
aa(lp592
V LEVITAN 
p593
aV Nah.

p603

p605
aV God bless you.  
p606
aa(lp607
V ELAINE 
p608
aV Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean    that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No    sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank...     yoooou!  
p609
aa(lp610
V LEVITAN 
p611
aV You're welcome.  
p612
aa(lp613
V ELAINE 
p614
aV People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have    you noticed that?  
p615
aa(lp616
V LEVITAN 
p617
aV No.  
p618
aa(lp619
V ELAINE 
p620
aV So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.   
p621
aa(lp622
V LEVITAN 
p623
aV Nudist colony?  
p624
aa(lp625
V ELAINE 
p626
aV Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!   
p627
aa(lp628
V LEVITAN 
p629
aV (laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.   
p630
aa(lp631
V ELAINE 
p632
aV Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of    course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this     clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my    office and I'll just sit there naked.  
p633
aa(lp634
V LEVITAN 
p635
aV Seriously?  
p636
aa(lp637
V ELAINE 
p638
aV Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.   
p639
aa(lp640
V GEORGE 
p641
aV (whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?   
p642
aa(lp643
V GLENDA 
p644
aV What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.   
p645
aa(lp646
V GEORGE 
p647
aV (whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.   
p648
aa(lp649
V GLENDA 
p650
aV What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.   
p651
aa(lp652
V GEORGE 
p653
aV (whispering) Okay. Okay. Fine.  
p654
aa(lp655
V ELAINE 
p656
aV I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked.    Naked. Naked.  
p657
aa(lp658
V LEVITAN 
p659
aV Who are you?  
p660
aa(lp661
V ELAINE 
p662
aV Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.    (lid on machine slams shut after Kramer opens it, forcing him to pour    concrete all over machine)  
p663
aa(lp664
V JERRY 
p665
aV What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?    (opening lid, Kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of    concrete covers his face)  
p666
aa(lp667
V JERRY 
p668
aV Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle    cycle?   (Kramer emptying bag into machine)  
p669
aa(lp670
V JERRY 
p671
aV What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of    temperament?   (finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag &    drops it on the floor)   (Kramer giving "OK" sign)   (Kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of    the machine)  
p672
aa(lp673
V JERRY 
p674
aV What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must    be something.   What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?   (Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with    dry concrete)  
p675
aa(lp676
V KRAMER 
p677
aV I didn't realize it was a full box.    
p678
aa(lp679
V GEORGE 
p680
aV I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig    is coming off.  
p681
aa(lp682
V GLENDA 
p683
aV I don't' wear a wig.  
p684
aa(lp685
V GEORGE 
p686
aV One...  
p687
aa(lp688
V ELAINE 
p689
aV No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I    really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.   (Levitan & Elaine laughing)  
p690
aa(lp691
V ELAINE 
p692
aV I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever    he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a    secret about my bra.   (George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink)     (Elaine & Levitan laughing)  
p693
aa(lp694
V GEORGE 
p695
aV Hello, Rick.  
p696

aV That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!  
p702
aa(lp703
V LEVITAN 
p704
aV You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.   
p705
aa(lp706
V GEORGE 
p707
aV Oh!  
p708
aa(lp709
V LEVITAN 
p710
aV I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.   
p711
aa(lp712
V GEORGE 
p713
aV Boom!   (all laughing)  
p714
aa(lp715
V LEVITAN 
p716
aV You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad    you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?   
p717
aa(lp718
V GEORGE 
p719
aV Oh.  
p720
aa(lp721
V LEVITAN 
p722
aV Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of    business? I, uh, I want   you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.    
p723
aa(lp724
V GEORGE 
p725
aV You want me to come back? Uh...  
p726
aa(lp727
V LEVITAN 
p728
aV Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!   
p729
aa(lp730
V GEORGE 
p731
aV Rick.  
p732
aa(lp733
V LEVITAN 
p734
aV Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr    Properties.  
p735
aa(lp736
V GEORGE 
p737
aV Uh, Rick..  
p738
aa(lp739
V LEVITAN 
p740
aV And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that    possible..  
p741
aa(lp742
V GEORGE 
p743
aV Rick.  
p744
aa(lp745
V LEVITAN 
p746
aV I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little    shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a    very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But,    hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the    office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?  
p747
aa(lp748
V GEORGE 
p749
aV Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor,    or something.  
p750
aa(lp751
V ELAINE 
p752
aV Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I    think you need a degree.  
p753
aa(lp754
V JERRY 
p755
aV Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you    find it?  
p756
aa(lp757
V KRAMER 
p758
aV It was in my laundry.  
p759
aa(lp760
V JERRY 
p761
aV In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys.    What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?  
p762
aa(lp763
V KRAMER 
p764
aV It was about 1200 bucks.  
p765
aa(lp766
V NEWMAN 
p767
aV Kramer!  
p768
aa(lp769
V KRAMER 
p770
aV Oh! That's Newman.  
p771
aa(lp772
V NEWMAN 
p773
aV I'm on the roof!  
p774
aa(lp775
V KRAMER 
p776
aV Well, what are you waiting for?  
p777
aa(lp778
V JERRY 
p779
aV Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta    pay this guy the money..  
p780
aa(lp781
V GEORGE 
p782
aV I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.   
p783
aa(lp784
V KRAMER 
p785
aV You wanna shoot some pool tonight?    
p786
aa(lp787
V NEWMAN 
p788
