a(V GEORGE

V That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.    Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.     (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You    are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at    you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking    object over on desk) I quit!

V Hey.  
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Hey.  
p11
tp12
a(V KRAMER 
p13
V Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last    night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the    roof to kill himself.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Well, what'd you say?  
p17
tp18
a(V KRAMER 
p19
V I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I    said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop    bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.   
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V What's his problem?  
p23
tp24
a(V KRAMER 
p25
V No job. No women.  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V He called the right guy.  
p29
tp30
a(V KRAMER 
p31
V What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live    for? Why should I lie to him?  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.   
p35
tp36
a(V KRAMER 
p37
V Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Fluff and fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with    words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.  
p41
tp42
a(V KRAMER 
p43
V How 'bout if I put a few things --    
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --  
p47
tp48
a(V KRAMER 
p49
V Well, you're going over there.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You    can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a    riot.  
p53
tp54
a(V KRAMER 
p55
V Have you ever met my guys?  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V No. I can't say as I have.  
p59
tp60
a(V KRAMER 
p61
V Well!  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V All right. Put 'em on top.  
p65
tp66
a(V KRAMER 
p67
V Ah!    
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done    in a separate machine?  
p71
tp72
a(V VIC 
p73
V I'll have to charge you for another machine.   
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are    not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump    across.  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V Guess what.  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V How did you know I was here?  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V Kramer. Guess what.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V I don't know.  
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V I quit my job.  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Get outta here.  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V I couldn't take it anymore.  
p98
tp99
a(V VIC 
p100
V You can have this on Monday.  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V What happened? Levitan?  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I    get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall.    Well, (laughing) we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!    
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V You and your toilets.  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)    
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else    in real estate?  
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.    
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V So what are you gonna do?  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V I like sports. I could do something in sports.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.   
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.   
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could    be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make    those interesting comments during the game.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.    
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V What about that?  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that    are, you know, in broadcasting.  
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V Well, that's really not fair.  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?   
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V Movies. I like to watch movies.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Yeah. Yeah.  
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V Do they pay people to watch movies?    
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Projectionists.  
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V That's true.  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V But you gotta know how to work the projector.    
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V Right.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V And it's probably a union thing.  
p176
tp177
a(V GEORGE 
p178
V (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a    talk show host?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Talk show host. That's good.  
p182
tp183
a(V GEORGE 
p184
V I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone    even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.    
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Really?  
p188
tp189
a(V GEORGE 
p190
V Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you    start?  
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Well, that's where it gets tricky.    
p194
tp195
a(V GEORGE 
p196
V You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk    show host."  
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V I wouldn't think so.  
p200
tp201
a(V GEORGE 
p202
V It's all politics.  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?   
p206
tp207
a(V GEORGE 
p208
V This could have been a huge mistake.    
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.   
p212
tp213
a(V GEORGE 
p214
V (sighs) What should I do?  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Maybe you can just go back.  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Go back?  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.    
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it    never happened?  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.   
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.   
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V Never happened.  
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?   
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V So what? You're entitled.  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V I'm emotional.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V That's right. You're emotional.  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V Never happened.  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V Never happened.    
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V How ya doin'?

p262
V What? I work here.

V What quit? (laughing) Who quit?

V Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?

p277
V Fine weekend.

a(V GEORGE 
p280
V Yeah. Good weekend.  
p281
tp282
a(V DAN 
p283
V Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a    little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor     someday.  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.

a(V LEVITAN 
p289
V Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?    
p290
tp291
a(V AVA 
p292
V I got a little tied up.  
p293
tp294
a(V LEVITAN 
p295
V I'll bet you did.   (laughter breaks out in boardroom)  
p296
tp297
a(V LEVITAN 
p298
V I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick    Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in    Lasky's Bar, Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really    means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing    here?  
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V What?  
p302
tp303
a(V LEVITAN 
p304
V Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?

p307
V When?  
p308
tp309
a(V LEVITAN 
p310
V Friday.  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You    took that seriously?  
p314
tp315
a(V LEVITAN 
p316
V You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?    
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V Come on. Will you stop it.  
p320
tp321
a(V LEVITAN 
p322
V No brains? No ability?  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Teasing.  
p326
tp327
a(V LEVITAN 
p328
V Okay. I want you outta here.  
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious    aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see?  
p332
tp333
a(V LEVITAN 
p334
V You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're    there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll     always be a loser.  
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is    what he said to me.  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Well, so that's that.  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V No. That's not that.  
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V That's not that?  
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V No.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Well, if that's not that, what is that?    
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V I've got some plans. I got plans.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V What kind of plans?  
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V What's the difference?  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V You don't wanna tell me?  
p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V I'm gonna slip him a mickey.  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you Peter    Lorre?  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been    looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole    thing.  
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V What if you destroy him?  
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched    it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.    
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing!    It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V You've really gone mental.  
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V Nah.  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying    "mickey"!  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V I got a sauce.  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V You got a mickey sauce?  
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.    
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V Elaine? How did you rope her into this?    
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.   
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V She knew that.  
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.    
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V What is the point of all this?  
p419
tp420
a(V GEORGE 
p421
V Revenge.  
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V Oh, the best revenge is living well.    
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V There's no chance of that.  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Did you get your laundry?  
p431
tp432
a(V KRAMER 
p433
V Yeah.  
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V What's with you?  
p437
tp438
a(V KRAMER 
p439
V He jumped.  
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V What?  
p443
tp444
a(V KRAMER 
p445
V Yeah. Newman jumped.  
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V Did he call you last night?  
p449
tp450
a(V KRAMER 
p451
V Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.    
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V What did you say?  
p455
tp456
a(V KRAMER 
p457
V I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."   
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Whew. Did he wave?  
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from    across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to    get back at me.  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Oh, my god!  
p467
tp468
a(V KRAMER 
p469
V What's the matter?  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some    reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely     forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on,    let's go.  
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V Where? Where?  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V To the Laundromat.  
p479
tp480
a(V VIC 
p481
V I never saw it.  
p482
tp483
a(V KRAMER 
p484
V Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?   
p485
tp486
a(V VIC 
p487
V Hey, you see that sign right there?    
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?   
p491
tp492
a(V VIC 
p493
V I'm not responsible.  
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a    license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?  
p497
tp498
a(V VIC 
p499
V You ever hear of a bank?  
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V Come on. Let's go.  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V No. You can't let him get away with this.   
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V Which one is he?  
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.   
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V Oh, yeah. I see him.  
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.  
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?   
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.   
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V Yeah. It is kind of cool.  
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.   
p530
tp531
a(V ELAINE 
p532
V I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do    in the movies.  
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V That's exactly what I told Jerry!  
p536
tp537
a(V ELAINE 
p538
V Really?  
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V Yes!   (both laughing)  
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V God, I've never felt so alive!  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V Maybe we should call this off.  
p548
tp549
a(V KRAMER 
p550
V Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in    the washing machine.  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V And what's gonna happen?  
p554
tp555
a(V KRAMER 
p556
V Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the    cycle it'll be a solid block!  
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like    Lex Luthor.  
p560
tp561
a(V KRAMER 
p562
V You keep him busy.   (Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine,     knocking chairs around)   (Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine)  
p563
tp564
a(V KRAMER 
p565
V Whoa!   (lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards    and slams into dryer)  
p566

V You go over there -  
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V Yeah.  
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're    keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.  
p575
tp576
a(V ELAINE 
p577
V Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?   
p578
tp579
a(V LEVITAN 
p580
V Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.   
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V Oops! 'Scuse me.  
p584
tp585
a(V LEVITAN 
p586

p592
V Nah.

p602

V God bless you.  
p605
tp606
a(V ELAINE 
p607
V Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean    that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No    sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank...     yoooou!  
p608
tp609
a(V LEVITAN 
p610
V You're welcome.  
p611
tp612
a(V ELAINE 
p613
V People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have    you noticed that?  
p614
tp615
a(V LEVITAN 
p616
V No.  
p617
tp618
a(V ELAINE 
p619
V So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.   
p620
tp621
a(V LEVITAN 
p622
V Nudist colony?  
p623
tp624
a(V ELAINE 
p625
V Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!   
p626
tp627
a(V LEVITAN 
p628
V (laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.   
p629
tp630
a(V ELAINE 
p631
V Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of    course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this     clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my    office and I'll just sit there naked.  
p632
tp633
a(V LEVITAN 
p634
V Seriously?  
p635
tp636
a(V ELAINE 
p637
V Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.   
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V (whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?   
p641
tp642
a(V GLENDA 
p643
V What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.   
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE 
p646
V (whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.   
p647
tp648
a(V GLENDA 
p649
V What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.   
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V (whispering) Okay. Okay. Fine.  
p653
tp654
a(V ELAINE 
p655
V I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked.    Naked. Naked.  
p656
tp657
a(V LEVITAN 
p658
V Who are you?  
p659
tp660
a(V ELAINE 
p661
V Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.    (lid on machine slams shut after Kramer opens it, forcing him to pour    concrete all over machine)  
p662
tp663
a(V JERRY 
p664
V What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?    (opening lid, Kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of    concrete covers his face)  
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle    cycle?   (Kramer emptying bag into machine)  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of    temperament?   (finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag &    drops it on the floor)   (Kramer giving "OK" sign)   (Kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of    the machine)  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must    be something.   What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?   (Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with    dry concrete)  
p674
tp675
a(V KRAMER 
p676
V I didn't realize it was a full box.    
p677
tp678
a(V GEORGE 
p679
V I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig    is coming off.  
p680
tp681
a(V GLENDA 
p682
V I don't' wear a wig.  
p683
tp684
a(V GEORGE 
p685
V One...  
p686
tp687
a(V ELAINE 
p688
V No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I    really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.   (Levitan & Elaine laughing)  
p689
tp690
a(V ELAINE 
p691
V I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever    he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a    secret about my bra.   (George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink)     (Elaine & Levitan laughing)  
p692
tp693
a(V GEORGE 
p694
V Hello, Rick.

tp702
a(V LEVITAN

V You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.   
p704
tp705
a(V GEORGE 
p706
V Oh!  
p707
tp708
a(V LEVITAN 
p709
V I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.   
p710
tp711
a(V GEORGE 
p712
V Boom!   (all laughing)  
p713
tp714
a(V LEVITAN 
p715
V You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad    you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?   
p716
tp717
a(V GEORGE 
p718
V Oh.  
p719
tp720
a(V LEVITAN 
p721
V Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of    business? I, uh, I want   you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.    
p722
tp723
a(V GEORGE 
p724
V You want me to come back? Uh...  
p725
tp726
a(V LEVITAN 
p727
V Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!   
p728
tp729
a(V GEORGE 
p730
V Rick.  
p731
tp732
a(V LEVITAN

V Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr    Properties.  
p734
tp735
a(V GEORGE 
p736
V Uh, Rick..  
p737
tp738
a(V LEVITAN 
p739
V And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that    possible..  
p740
tp741
a(V GEORGE 
p742
V Rick.  
p743
tp744
a(V LEVITAN 
p745
V I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little    shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a    very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But,    hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the    office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?  
p746
tp747
a(V GEORGE 
p748
V Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor,    or something.  
p749
tp750
a(V ELAINE 
p751
V Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I    think you need a degree.  
p752
tp753
a(V JERRY 
p754
V Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you    find it?  
p755
tp756
a(V KRAMER 
p757
V It was in my laundry.  
p758
tp759
a(V JERRY 
p760
V In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys.    What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?  
p761
tp762
a(V KRAMER 
p763
V It was about 1200 bucks.  
p764
tp765
a(V NEWMAN 
p766
V Kramer!  
p767
tp768
a(V KRAMER

V Oh! That's Newman.  
p770
tp771
a(V NEWMAN 
p772
V I'm on the roof!  
p773
tp774
a(V KRAMER 
p775
V Well, what are you waiting for?  
p776
tp777
a(V JERRY 
p778
V Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta    pay this guy the money..  
p779
tp780
a(V GEORGE 
p781
V I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.   
p782
tp783
a(V KRAMER 
p784
V You wanna shoot some pool tonight?    
p785
tp786
