aV  THE APARTMENT  Written by Peter Mehlman     (Night club)   Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around,     and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I    paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to    push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what    I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through space in your living room, watching    TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be    there.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked down)

aV What did you do?  
p6
aa(lp7
V KRAMER 
p8
aV Mousse. I moussed up.  
p9
aa(lp10
V ELAINE 
p11
aV I guess it was just a matter of time.    
p12
aa(lp13
V KRAMER 
p14
aV You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth,    have you ever seen a better looking guy?  
p15
aa(lp16
V JERRY 
p17
aV Oh, look, its so subjective.  
p18
aa(lp19
V ELAINE 
p20
aV I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.    
p21
aa(lp22
V KRAMER 
p23
aV Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.    
p24
aa(lp25
V ELAINE 
p26
aV She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.   
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV Maybe.   (A loud argument erupts in the hallway between Harold and Manny, the building supervisors)   
p30
aa(lp31
V HAROLD 
p32
aV No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something in Spanish)   
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV Harold and Manny.  
p36
aa(lp37
V HAROLD 
p38
aV I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the hall)   
p39
aa(lp40

p41
aV Boys, boys.  
p42
aa(lp43
V HAROLD 
p44
aV Oh, Jerry.  
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?   
p48
aa(lp49
V HAROLD 
p50
aV Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold in Spanish) I was only    joking. (To Jerry) He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. (Manny starts talking in Spanish) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.    It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month.   
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?  
p54
aa(lp55
V HAROLD 
p56
aV Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.    
p57
aa(lp58
V MANNY 
p59
aV Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!   
p60
aa(lp61
V HAROLD 
p62
aV (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?   
p63
aa(lp64
V JERRY 
p65
aV Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?   
p66
aa(lp67
V HAROLD 
p68
aV Oh yeah, I like her. She always says "hello" to me.   
p69
aa(lp70
V JERRY 
p71
aV It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.   
p72
aa(lp73
V HAROLD 
p74
aV Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's true.   
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?   
p78
aa(lp79
V HAROLD 
p80
aV Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.     (Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way)    
p81
aa(lp82
V KRAMER 
p83
aV (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?   
p84
aa(lp85
V HAROLD 
p86
aV Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.   
p87
aa(lp88
V MANNY 
p89
aV (In Spanish) It looks worse.  
p90
aa(lp91
V KRAMER 
p92
aV (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.     (Jerry enters his apartment)  
p93
aa(lp94
V ELAINE 
p95
aV What was that all about?  
p96
aa(lp97
V JERRY 
p98
aV Oh, nothing important.  
p99
aa(lp100
V ELAINE 
p101
aV What's going on? What is that look?    
p102
aa(lp103
V JERRY 
p104
aV What look? Nothing.  
p105
aa(lp106
V ELAINE 
p107
aV Something's going on here.  
p108
aa(lp109
V JERRY 
p110
aV I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.   
p111
aa(lp112
V ELAINE 
p113
aV Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.   
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts     sometimes - to give, and give, and give..  
p117
aa(lp118
V ELAINE 
p119
aV Would you please?  
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV What would you say if I told you that..    
p123
aa(lp124
V ELAINE 
p125
aV Told me what?!  
p126
aa(lp127
V JERRY 
p128
aV ..I got you an apartment in this building.    
p129
aa(lp130
V ELAINE 
p131
aV (Dumbfounded) No.  
p132
aa(lp133
V JERRY 
p134
aV Yes.  
p135
aa(lp136
V ELAINE 
p137
aV No.  
p138
aa(lp139
V JERRY 
p140
aV Yes.  
p141
aa(lp142
V ELAINE 
p143
aV You didn't.  
p144
aa(lp145
V JERRY 
p146
aV I did.  
p147
aa(lp148
V ELAINE 
p149
aV You got me an apartment in the building?!    
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV I got you an apartment in the building.    
p153
aa(lp154
V ELAINE 
p155
aV How did you..  
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?   
p159
aa(lp160
V ELAINE 
p161
aV No.  
p162
aa(lp163
V JERRY 
p164
aV She died.  
p165
aa(lp166
V ELAINE 
p167
aV (Thrilled) She died?!  
p168
aa(lp169
V JERRY 
p170
aV She died.  
p171
aa(lp172
V ELAINE 
p173
aV She died!  
p174
aa(lp175
V JERRY 
p176
aV And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!   
p177
aa(lp178
V ELAINE 
p179
aV Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!   
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV Four hundred a month.  
p183
aa(lp184
V ELAINE 
p185
aV And I'll be right upstairs?  
p186
aa(lp187
V JERRY 
p188
aV Right upstairs.  
p189
aa(lp190
V ELAINE 
p191
aV Right above you?  
p192
aa(lp193
V JERRY 
p194
aV Right above me.  
p195
aa(lp196
V ELAINE 
p197
aV Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!   
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..   
p201
aa(lp202
V ELAINE 
p203
aV We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!   
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY 
p206
aV ..All the time..   (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.     You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out    somewhere with people, "Gee, you look pregnant.. are ya?" "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take    this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!"     (Scene ends)   (Coffee shop)  
p210
aa(lp211
V GEORGE 
p212
aV (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?    
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV You can't believe what I just did.    
p216
aa(lp217
V GEORGE 
p218
aV What? What did you do?  
p219
aa(lp220
V JERRY 
p221
aV I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.    
p222
aa(lp223
V GEORGE 
p224
aV What did you do?  
p225
aa(lp226
V JERRY 
p227
aV How could I have done that?  
p228
aa(lp229
V GEORGE 
p230
aV Done what?  
p231
aa(lp232
V JERRY 
p233
aV I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.   
p234
aa(lp235
V GEORGE 
p236
aV Elaine's moving into your building?    
p237
aa(lp238
V JERRY 
p239
aV Yes. Right above me.  
p240
aa(lp241
V GEORGE 
p242
aV Right above you?  
p243
aa(lp244
V JERRY 
p245
aV Yes.  
p246
aa(lp247
V GEORGE 
p248
aV You're gonna be neighbors.  
p249
aa(lp250
V JERRY 
p251
aV I know. Neighbors.  
p252
aa(lp253
V GEORGE 
p254
aV She's right above you?  
p255
aa(lp256
V JERRY 
p257
aV Right above me.  
p258
aa(lp259
V GEORGE 
p260
aV How could you do that?  
p261
aa(lp262
V JERRY 
p263
aV 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.    
p264
aa(lp265
V GEORGE 
p266
aV Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.   
p267
aa(lp268
V JERRY 
p269
aV Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?   
p270
aa(lp271
V GEORGE 
p272
aV Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?   
p273
aa(lp274
V JERRY 
p275
aV She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.   
p276
aa(lp277
V GEORGE 
p278
aV You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed    advantage.  
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV But I need the home bed advantage!    
p282
aa(lp283
V GEORGE 
p284
aV Of course, we all do.  
p285
aa(lp286
V JERRY 
p287
aV (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and sit with me.    
p288
aa(lp289
V GEORGE 
p290
aV I was just in there. It's embarrassing.    
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV Oh, who's gonna know?  
p294
aa(lp295
V GEORGE 
p296
aV They saw me walk out.  
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV Two minutes.   (Scene cuts to Jerry and George in the coffee shop)  
p300
aa(lp301
V JERRY 
p302
aV My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went     for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.  
p303
aa(lp304
V GEORGE 
p305
aV My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.    
p306
aa(lp307
V JERRY 
p308
aV ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?   
p309
aa(lp310
V GEORGE 
p311
aV Tough.  
p312
aa(lp313
V JERRY 
p314
aV You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.   
p315
aa(lp316
V GEORGE 
p317
aV I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.    
p318
aa(lp319
V JERRY 
p320
aV If they were fanatic about showers, they might.   
p321
aa(lp322
V GEORGE 
p323
aV For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..   
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?    
p327
aa(lp328
V GEORGE 
p329
aV I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?   
p330
aa(lp331
V JERRY 
p332
aV Yeah, the guy with the flat head?  
p333
aa(lp334
V GEORGE 
p335
aV He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him    everywhere he goes.  
p336
aa(lp337
V JERRY 
p338
aV Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.   
p339
aa(lp340
V GEORGE 
p341
aV (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.    
p342
aa(lp343
V JERRY 
p344
aV That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.     (Scene ends)   (Apartment buliding hallway)   (George is trying on a wedding band)  
p345
aa(lp346
V GEORGE 
p347
aV Thanks a lot. I"ll give it back to you in a week.   
p348
aa(lp349
V KRAMER 
p350
aV You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.   
p351
aa(lp352
V GEORGE 
p353
aV I'm not doing that.  
p354
aa(lp355
V KRAMER 
p356
aV Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?   
p357
aa(lp358
V GEORGE 
p359
aV No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.    (Manny and Harold are arguing again from down the hall)  
p360
aa(lp361
V HAROLD 
p362
aV I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!     (Manny yells in Spanish, Jerry exits his apartment)  
p363
aa(lp364
V JERRY 
p365
aV Boys, boys.  
p366
aa(lp367
V HAROLD 
p368
aV Hi, Jerry.  
p369
aa(lp370
V HAROLD 
p371
aV Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)   
p372
aa(lp373
V HAROLD 
p374
aV Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.   
p375
aa(lp376
V JERRY 
p377
aV What?  
p378
aa(lp379
V HAROLD 
p380
aV Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny yells) Because it's true!     Why shouldn't I tell him?  
p381
aa(lp382
V JERRY 
p383
aV Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks in Spanish)   
p384
aa(lp385
V HAROLD 
p386
aV Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.   
p387
aa(lp388
V JERRY 
p389
aV Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) You know, I used to think that the    universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.    
p390
aa(lp391
V GEORGE 
p392
aV What happened to you?  
p393
aa(lp394
V JERRY 
p395
aV Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the     apartment upstairs.  
p396
aa(lp397
V GEORGE 
p398
aV Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!   
p399
aa(lp400
V JERRY 
p401
aV Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!   
p402
aa(lp403
V GEORGE 
p404
aV So, she can't get the apartment.  
p405
aa(lp406
V JERRY 
p407
aV Can't get it.  
p408
aa(lp409
V GEORGE 
p410
aV So, she doesn't move in.  
p411
aa(lp412
V JERRY 
p413
aV No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.   
p414
aa(lp415
V GEORGE 
p416
aV And how does the baldness fit into that plan?    (The intercom buzzes)  
p417
aa(lp418
V JERRY 
p419
aV (Into the intercom) Elaine?  
p420
aa(lp421
V ELAINE 
p422
aV Yeah.  
p423
aa(lp424
V JERRY 
p425
aV (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see    me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this.. maybe you should go in the other room.   
p426
aa(lp427
V GEORGE 
p428
aV Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!    
p429
aa(lp430
V JERRY 
p431
aV 'Cause you know, I love Elaine.  
p432
aa(lp433
V GEORGE 
p434
aV Of course you do.  
p435
aa(lp436
V JERRY 
p437
aV But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..     (To someone in the hallway) No, I'll be seeing you. (Starts to sing) "Good morning, good morning.." Have you ever gotten up in the morning    and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? (George leaves, and goes to the other room) Oh, and before I forget, I have the    checks for first month, last month, security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.   
p438
aa(lp439
V JERRY 
p440
aV (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.   
p441
aa(lp442
V ELAINE 
p443
aV Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, "Why stand when    you can sit?" Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies..  
p444
aa(lp445
V JERRY 
p446
aV No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that    money.  
p447
aa(lp448
V ELAINE 
p449
aV Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.   
p450
aa(lp451
V JERRY 
p452
aV I know.  
p453
aa(lp454
V ELAINE 
p455
aV How am I going to get five thousand dollars?   
p456
aa(lp457
V JERRY 
p458
aV I have no idea.   (Enter Kramer)  
p459
aa(lp460
V KRAMER 
p461
aV Hey, my new neighbor!  
p462
aa(lp463
V ELAINE 
p464
aV I'm not moving in.  
p465
aa(lp466
V KRAMER 
p467
aV What?  
p468
aa(lp469
V ELAINE 
p470
aV They want five thousand dollars now.    
p471
aa(lp472
V KRAMER

p489
aa(lp490

aV She doesn't want to borrow the money.    
p492
aa(lp493
V KRAMER 
p494

aV He said he'd loan you the money.  
p507
aa(lp508
V ELAINE 
p509
aV Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?   
p510
aa(lp511
V KRAMER 
p512
aV That's okay. He doesn't care.  
p513
aa(lp514
V ELAINE 
p515
aV You know, money can sometimes come between friends.   
p516
aa(lp517
V KRAMER 
p518
aV Get outta here.  
p519
aa(lp520
V ELAINE 
p521
aV Let me think about it.  
p522
aa(lp523
V KRAMER 
p524
aV What's to think about?  
p525
aa(lp526
V ELAINE 
p527
aV I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it. (Leaves)   
p528
aa(lp529
V JERRY 
p530
aV It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye.     She's gone. Then you come in, "Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand."    
p531
aa(lp532
V KRAMER 
p533
aV You didn't want her in the building?    
p534
aa(lp535

p536
aV No, I didn't!  
p537
aa(lp538
V KRAMER 
p539
aV Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.    
p540
aa(lp541
V JERRY 
p542
aV People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.   
p543
aa(lp544
V KRAMER 
p545
aV I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.   
p546
aa(lp547
V JERRY 
p548
aV Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. 
p549
aa(lp550
V I 
p551
aV   sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.    
p552
aa(lp553
V KRAMER 
p554
aV Because I'm a pod?   (George returns for Jerry's bedroom just as Elaine returns)

p573
aa(lp574
V GEORGE 
p575
aV (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't     let any one kid you, it's tough. (Goes off to mingle)  
p576

aV I wish we had a view of the finish line.    
p588
aa(lp589
V JERRY 
p590
aV What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.    (Roxanne makes a face, Scene guts to George. He's standing next to an attractive woman)   
p591
aa(lp592

p651
aa(lp652
V SUSIE 
p653
aV So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.    
p654
aa(lp655
V GEORGE 
p656
aV You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.   
p657
aa(lp658
V SUSIE 
p659
aV That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)

V RITA

V ELAINE 
p671
aV Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.   
p672
aa(lp673
V JERRY 
p674
aV I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.    
p675
aa(lp676
V ELAINE 
p677
aV Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?

p681

p684
aa(lp685
V JANICE 
p686
aV I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame    you're married..  
p687
aa(lp688
V GEORGE 
p689
aV (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!   
p690
aa(lp691
V JANICE 
p692
aV Please.. (Walks away)   (Jerry walks over to George)  
p693
aa(lp694
V JERRY

aV You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This is an idiot.   
p696
aa(lp697
V GEORGE 
p698
aV Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please,     a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots!  
p699
aa(lp700
V ROXANNE 
p701

p705
aa(lp706
V JERRY 
p707
aV (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you    listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. (Kramer enters) I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.

p732
aa(lp733
V KRAMER 
p734
aV He's in the music business.  
p735
aa(lp736
V JERRY 
p737
aV Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear    here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. I"m golden!   
p738
aa(lp739
V KRAMER 
p740
aV Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Harold and Manny are in Jerry's apartment. A pulsing music is coming through the walls)

V ELAINE 
p749
aV They rehearse all the time?  
p750
aa(lp751
V JERRY 
p752
aV All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)    Can't you do something?  
p753
aa(lp754
V HAROLD 
p755

aV (In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.   
p762
aa(lp763
V HAROLD 
p764
aV I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.   
p765
aa(lp766
V ELAINE 
p767
aV Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.    (Kramer enters)  
p768
