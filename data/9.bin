V  THE APARTMENT  Written by Peter Mehlman     (Night club)   Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around,     and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I    paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to    push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what    I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through space in your living room, watching    TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be    there.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked down)

V What did you do?  
p5
tp6
a(V KRAMER 
p7
V Mousse. I moussed up.  
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V I guess it was just a matter of time.    
p11
tp12
a(V KRAMER 
p13
V You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth,    have you ever seen a better looking guy?  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Oh, look, its so subjective.  
p17
tp18
a(V ELAINE 
p19
V I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.    
p20
tp21
a(V KRAMER 
p22
V Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.    
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.   
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V Maybe.   (A loud argument erupts in the hallway between Harold and Manny, the building supervisors)   
p29
tp30
a(V HAROLD 
p31
V No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something in Spanish)   
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Harold and Manny.  
p35
tp36
a(V HAROLD 
p37
V I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the hall)   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Boys, boys.  
p41
tp42
a(V HAROLD 
p43
V Oh, Jerry.  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?   
p47
tp48
a(V HAROLD 
p49
V Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold in Spanish) I was only    joking. (To Jerry) He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. (Manny starts talking in Spanish) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.    It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month.   
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?  
p53
tp54
a(V HAROLD 
p55
V Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.    
p56
tp57
a(V MANNY 
p58
V Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!   
p59
tp60
a(V HAROLD 
p61
V (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?   
p65
tp66
a(V HAROLD 
p67
V Oh yeah, I like her. She always says "hello" to me.   
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.   
p71
tp72
a(V HAROLD 
p73
V Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's true.   
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?   
p77
tp78
a(V HAROLD 
p79
V Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.     (Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way)    
p80
tp81
a(V KRAMER 
p82
V (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?   
p83
tp84
a(V HAROLD 
p85
V Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.   
p86
tp87
a(V MANNY 
p88
V (In Spanish) It looks worse.  
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.     (Jerry enters his apartment)  
p92
tp93
a(V ELAINE 
p94
V What was that all about?  
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Oh, nothing important.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V What's going on? What is that look?    
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V What look? Nothing.  
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE 
p106
V Something's going on here.  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.   
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINE 
p112
V Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.   
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts     sometimes - to give, and give, and give..  
p116
tp117
a(V ELAINE 
p118
V Would you please?  
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V What would you say if I told you that..    
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V Told me what?!  
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V ..I got you an apartment in this building.    
p128
tp129
a(V ELAINE 
p130
V (Dumbfounded) No.  
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V Yes.  
p134
tp135
a(V ELAINE 
p136
V No.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Yes.  
p140
tp141
a(V ELAINE 
p142
V You didn't.  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V I did.  
p146
tp147
a(V ELAINE 
p148
V You got me an apartment in the building?!    
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V I got you an apartment in the building.    
p152
tp153
a(V ELAINE 
p154
V How did you..  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?   
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V No.  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V She died.  
p164
tp165
a(V ELAINE 
p166
V (Thrilled) She died?!  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V She died.  
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V She died!  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!   
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!   
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Four hundred a month.  
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V And I'll be right upstairs?  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Right upstairs.  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V Right above you?  
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Right above me.  
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINE 
p196
V Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!   
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..   
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V ..All the time..   (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.     You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out    somewhere with people, "Gee, you look pregnant.. are ya?" "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take    this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!"     (Scene ends)   (Coffee shop)  
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?    
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V You can't believe what I just did.    
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V What? What did you do?  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.    
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V What did you do?  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V How could I have done that?  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Done what?  
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.   
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Elaine's moving into your building?    
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Yes. Right above me.  
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V Right above you?  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Yes.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V You're gonna be neighbors.  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V I know. Neighbors.  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V She's right above you?  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V Right above me.  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V How could you do that?  
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.    
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.   
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?   
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?   
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.   
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed    advantage.  
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V But I need the home bed advantage!    
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V Of course, we all do.  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and sit with me.    
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V I was just in there. It's embarrassing.    
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V Oh, who's gonna know?  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V They saw me walk out.  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Two minutes.   (Scene cuts to Jerry and George in the coffee shop)  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went     for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.  
p302
tp303
a(V GEORGE 
p304
V My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.    
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?   
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V Tough.  
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.    
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V If they were fanatic about showers, they might.   
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..   
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?    
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?   
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Yeah, the guy with the flat head?  
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him    everywhere he goes.  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.   
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.    
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.     (Scene ends)   (Apartment buliding hallway)   (George is trying on a wedding band)  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V Thanks a lot. I"ll give it back to you in a week.   
p347
tp348
a(V KRAMER 
p349
V You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.   
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V I'm not doing that.  
p353
tp354
a(V KRAMER 
p355
V Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?   
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.    (Manny and Harold are arguing again from down the hall)  
p359
tp360
a(V HAROLD 
p361
V I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!     (Manny yells in Spanish, Jerry exits his apartment)  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Boys, boys.  
p365
tp366
a(V HAROLD 
p367
V Hi, Jerry.  
p368
tp369
a(V HAROLD 
p370
V Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)   
p371
tp372
a(V HAROLD 
p373
V Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.   
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V What?  
p377
tp378
a(V HAROLD 
p379
V Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny yells) Because it's true!     Why shouldn't I tell him?  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks in Spanish)   
p383
tp384
a(V HAROLD 
p385
V Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.   
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) You know, I used to think that the    universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.    
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V What happened to you?  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the     apartment upstairs.  
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!   
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V So, she can't get the apartment.  
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V Can't get it.  
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V So, she doesn't move in.  
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.   
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V And how does the baldness fit into that plan?    (The intercom buzzes)  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V (Into the intercom) Elaine?  
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V Yeah.  
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see    me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this.. maybe you should go in the other room.   
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!    
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V 'Cause you know, I love Elaine.  
p431
tp432
a(V GEORGE 
p433
V Of course you do.  
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..     (To someone in the hallway) No, I'll be seeing you. (Starts to sing) "Good morning, good morning.." Have you ever gotten up in the morning    and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? (George leaves, and goes to the other room) Oh, and before I forget, I have the    checks for first month, last month, security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.   
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.   
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, "Why stand when    you can sit?" Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies..  
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that    money.  
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.   
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V I know.  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V How am I going to get five thousand dollars?   
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V I have no idea.   (Enter Kramer)  
p458
tp459
a(V KRAMER 
p460
V Hey, my new neighbor!  
p461
tp462
a(V ELAINE 
p463
V I'm not moving in.  
p464
tp465
a(V KRAMER 
p466
V What?  
p467
tp468
a(V ELAINE 
p469
V They want five thousand dollars now.    
p470
tp471
a(V KRAMER 
p472
V So, okay. What's the problem?  
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V I don't have five thousand dollars.    
p476
tp477
a(V KRAMER 
p478
V C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.   
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?

V No, that's too much money to borrow.    
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V Loan her the money. You can afford it.    
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V She doesn't want to borrow the money.    
p491
tp492
a(V KRAMER 
p493
V Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?   
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V Of course I'd pay you back..  
p497
tp498
a(V KRAMER

V Yeah, so what's the problem?  
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V Who said there's a problem?  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V He said he'd loan you the money.  
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?   
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V That's okay. He doesn't care.  
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V You know, money can sometimes come between friends.   
p515
tp516
a(V KRAMER 
p517
V Get outta here.  
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Let me think about it.  
p521
tp522
a(V KRAMER 
p523
V What's to think about?  
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it. (Leaves)   
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye.     She's gone. Then you come in, "Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand."    
p530
tp531
a(V KRAMER 
p532
V You didn't want her in the building?    
p533
tp534
a(V JERRY 
p535
V No, I didn't!  
p536
tp537
a(V KRAMER 
p538
V Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.    
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.   
p542
tp543
a(V KRAMER 
p544
V I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.   
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. 
p548
tp549
a(V I 
p550
V   sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.    
p551
tp552
a(V KRAMER 
p553
V Because I'm a pod?   (George returns for Jerry's bedroom just as Elaine returns)    
p554
tp555
a(V ELAINE 
p556
V I'll take it!   (George turns on his heels, and goes back into Jerry's room)     (Scene ends)   (Roxanne's apartment)   (Guests are milling around, eating. Elaine enters with Jerry and George. Roxanne greets them)

p560
tp561
a(V ELAINE

V Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's the one who got me my new     apartment!  
p563
tp564
a(V ROXANNE 
p565
V So, you're Elaine's hero.  
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Yeah, it's my life's work.  
p569
tp570
a(V ROXANNE 
p571
V There are so few true heros left in this world. (Jerry's attracted to Roxanne, Elaine notices)   
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't     let any one kid you, it's tough. (Goes off to mingle)  
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts selecting food from the tables)   
p578

a(V ROXANNE 
p580
V Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?    
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.   
p584
tp585
a(V ROXANNE 
p586
V I wish we had a view of the finish line.    
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.    (Roxanne makes a face, Scene guts to George. He's standing next to an attractive woman)   
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.

V What does she do?  
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. What about you?    
p605
tp606
a(V RITA 
p607
V I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. (George is stunned) Anyway, she's a    very luck woman.  
p608

V Fantastic..

V I know.  
p629

a(V JOANNE

p647
tp648
a(V GEORGE 
p649
V I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh flirtingly)   
p650
tp651
a(V SUSIE 
p652
V So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.    
p653
tp654
a(V GEORGE 
p655
V You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.   
p656
tp657
a(V SUSIE 
p658
V That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)    
p659
tp660
a(V RITA 
p661
V Hey everybody! Here come the runners!     (Everyone runs to the windows. Jerry and Elaine stay put)  
p662
tp663
a(V ELAINE 
p664
V So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?   
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.  
p668
tp669
a(V ELAINE 
p670
V Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.   
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.    
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?    
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V Na..  
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as    you're okay with it, it's fine with me.   (Scene cuts to George)  
p683
tp684
a(V JANICE 
p685
V I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame    you're married..  
p686
tp687
a(V GEORGE 
p688
V (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!   
p689
tp690
a(V JANICE 
p691
V Please.. (Walks away)   (Jerry walks over to George)  
p692
tp693
a(V JERRY 
p694
V You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This is an idiot.   
p695
tp696
a(V GEORGE 
p697
V Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please,     a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots!  
p698
tp699
a(V ROXANNE 
p700
V (Yelling out the window) You're all winners!   
p701
tp702
a(V GEORGE

V But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)  
p704
tp705
a(V JERRY 
p706
V (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you    listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. (Kramer enters) I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.   
p707
tp708
a(V KRAMER 
p709
V Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.

p719
tp720
a(V KRAMER 
p721
V I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.    
p722
tp723
a(V JERRY 
p724
V You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?  
p725
tp726
a(V KRAMER 
p727
V (Nods) Cash.  
p728
tp729
a(V JERRY 
p730
V Who would pay that much?  
p731
tp732
a(V KRAMER 
p733
V He's in the music business.  
p734
tp735
a(V JERRY 
p736
V Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear    here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. I"m golden!   
p737
tp738
a(V KRAMER 
p739
V Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Harold and Manny are in Jerry's apartment. A pulsing music is coming through the walls)   
p740
tp741
a(V ELAINE 
p742
V Wow. You're right. That is loud.  
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V It's just unbelievable.  
p746
tp747
a(V ELAINE 
p748
V They rehearse all the time?  
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)    Can't you do something?  
p752
tp753
a(V HAROLD 
p754
V I'm not going up. It stinks up there.    
p755
tp756
a(V JERRY 
p757
V Manny..  
p758
tp759
a(V MANNY 
p760
V (In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.   
p761
tp762
a(V HAROLD 
p763
V I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.   
p764
tp765
a(V ELAINE 
p766
V Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.    (Kramer enters)  
p767
tp768
a(V KRAMER 
p769
