aVthe statue written by larry charles i have to tell you that i did some very exciting news recently, and i don't know if i should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. well, i will tell you what i know so far. according to the information that i have in the envelope that i've received, it seems that i may have already won some very valuable prizes. well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. it's very nice to hear that. but, in all honesty, i have to say, i didn't even know i was in this thing. but, according to the readout, it looks like i am among the top people that they are considering. you know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, you may have already won. i'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. send out envelopes, you have definitely lost! you turn it over, giant printing, not even close! you open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest.

p200
aVi don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. you know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, i'm really sorry about this. i don't know why i let that stuff over there. and that's why i could never be a maid, because i'd have an attitude. i'd find them, whereever they are in the house, oh, i suppose you couldn't do this? no, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. no, you couldn't dust. no, this is too tough, isn't it?
p201
aa(lp202
Vjerry

aVhe really did an amazing job, look! he uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. he cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. come here, look at this. he cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. how did he get in there? he must be like rubber man!

p751
aa(lp752
Vgeorge
p753

aa(lp770
Vkramer
p771
aVi'm not happy about this.
p772
aa(lp773
Vjerry
p774
aVwell, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice
p775
