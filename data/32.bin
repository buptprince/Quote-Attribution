V  THE FIX-UP  Written by Larry Charles & Elaine Pope     (Comedy club)   I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. I mean   between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need   somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really help   you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap,   start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, once   it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist   looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to   do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, thank you very   much."    Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.   Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet   anybody, I should just accept it.  
p2
tp3
a(V JERRY 
p4
V Oh, yes you will.  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V No, I won't.  
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Yeah, maybe you won't.  
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.   
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Are my nostrils getting bigger?  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and   hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm   George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?   Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi'   which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times   as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that   anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)      Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.   
p20
tp21
a(V CYNTHIA 
p22
V There's just no men out there, you know?    
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V I know.  
p26
tp27
a(V CYNTHIA 
p28
V I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they   know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves   to one person.  
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V I hate the good ones.  
p32
tp33
a(V CYNTHIA 
p34
V Is Jerry one of the good ones?  
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.   
p38
tp39
a(V CYNTHIA 
p40
V Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about   not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good   enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're   right."  
p41
tp42
a(V ELAINE 
p43
V You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.   
p44
tp45
a(V CYNTHIA 
p46
V No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to   appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.    Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.  
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on   the phone. I almost made a date with one.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V Oh, so there's still hope.  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become   hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that   indifference makes you attractive.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V Oh, so hopelessness is the key.  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V It's my only hope.    Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.  
p62
tp63
a(V CYNTHIA 
p64
V See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother.   I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling   you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her   because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.   
p65
tp66
a(V ELAINE 
p67
V Well, at least you're not bitter.  
p68
tp69
a(V CYNTHIA 
p70
V Who says I'm not bitter?  
p71
tp72
a(V ELAINE 
p73
V Aren't you too young to be bitter?    
p74
tp75
a(V CYNTHIA 
p76
V No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna   be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.    
p77
tp78
a(V ELAINE 
p79
V Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.   
p80
tp81
a(V CYNTHIA 
p82
V Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.      Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.    
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should   give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.    
p86
tp87
a(V ELAINE 
p88
V So what'd you do last night?  
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V Went out with George, you?  
p92
tp93
a(V ELAINE 
p94
V Went out with Cynthia.  
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V How was it? What'd you talk about?    
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest.   Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one   fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What   about you?  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't   find anybody.  
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE 
p106
V I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.   
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V George too.   They look at each other for a moment.  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p112
V Yeah, right.  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V I've never fixed anybody up.  
p116
tp117
a(V ELAINE 
p118
V Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.   
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for   George?  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Well you implied it.  
p128
tp129
a(V ELAINE 
p130
V I didn't say it.  
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.   Dead wrong. Who is she?  
p134
tp135
a(V ELAINE 
p136
V Who is he?  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V He's George!  
p140
tp141
a(V ELAINE 
p142
V She's Cynthia!  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V So what?  
p146
tp147
a(V ELAINE 
p148
V What, you don't think she's beautiful?    
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?    
p152
tp153
a(V ELAINE 
p154
V You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.   
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V I went out with you.  
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,   women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their   real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald   above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.   
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run   like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his   head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but   George can bait a hook.  
p164
tp165
a(V ELAINE 
p166
V He can really do that?  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.   
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V What, are you into this?  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Yeah, come on, it's a good match.  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how   their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Naturally.  
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean   every secret?  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Everything.  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V What if it worked out?  
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Yeah right.     Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.  
p194
tp195
a(V GEORGE 
p196
V Out of the question. Out of the question!    
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V Why?  
p200
tp201
a(V GEORGE 
p202
V No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads!   And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look   like?  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V She's good looking.  
p206
tp207
a(V GEORGE 
p208
V How good looking?  
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V Very good looking.  
p212
tp213
a(V GEORGE 
p214
V Really good looking?  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Really very good looking.  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Would you take her out?  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Yes, I would take her out.  
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V Oh, you hesitated.  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!  
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V No, something's off here, you hesitated.    
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V I'm telling you, she's good looking.    
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V What about the body, what kind of body?    
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V Good body, nice body.  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V How nice?  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Nice.  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V Just nice?  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V Pretty nice.  
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Really good?  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V Really very nice and good.  
p260
tp261
a(V GEORGE 
p262
V What about personality?  
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Good personality. Funny. Bright.  
p266
tp267
a(V GEORGE 
p268
V Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.   
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V How could she be smarter than you?    
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what   does she do?     Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.  
p275
tp276
a(V CYNTHIA 
p277
V First of all, what does he do?  
p278
tp279
a(V ELAINE 
p280
V He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-   
p281
tp282
a(V CYNTHIA 
p283
V He's not working?! How come he's not working?   
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Well, um, he, he got fired.  
p287
tp288
a(V CYNTHIA 
p289
V Why did he get fired?  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.   
p293
tp294
a(V CYNTHIA 
p295
V Excuse me?  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems   at work.  
p299
tp300
a(V CYNTHIA 
p301
V Is he nuts?  
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.   
p305
tp306
a(V CYNTHIA 
p307
V What does he look like?  
p308
tp309
a(V ELAINE 
p310
V Pardon?  
p311
tp312
a(V CYNTHIA 
p313
V What does he look like?  
p314
tp315
a(V ELAINE 
p316
V Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short.   Um, he's stocky.  
p317
tp318
a(V CYNTHIA 
p319
V Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?   
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up   over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind   of, just kind of losing his hair.  
p323
tp324
a(V CYNTHIA 
p325
V He's bald?  
p326
tp327
a(V ELAINE 
p328
V No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.   
p329
tp330
a(V CYNTHIA 
p331
V So he will be bald.  
p332
tp333
a(V ELAINE 
p334
V Yup.    Cut back to Jerry and George.  
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V What kind of hair?  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V You know, long dark hair.  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V Flowing?  
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V Flowing?  
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is   very important to me.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?   
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V Yeah, that's right.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Just clarifying.  
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to   get it out?  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to   get it out?  
p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V I'd like to be able to get it out.    
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V I think you'll get it out.  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.   
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V She's got a fine cheek.  
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V Is there a pinkish hue?  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V A pinkish hue?  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Yes, a rosy glow.  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her   eyebrows.  
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too   sweet, you could throw up from that.  
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.     Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.  
p395
tp396
a(V CYNTHIA 
p397
V Has he ever been married?  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V No.  
p401
tp402
a(V CYNTHIA 
p403
V Has he been close?  
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V He once spent a weekend with a woman.    
p407
tp408
a(V CYNTHIA 
p409
V He didn't really try to poison his boss?    
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V Yeah, he did.     The next day, George is back at Jerry's.  
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty   minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought   she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V I think it's tamber.  
p419
tp420
a(V GEORGE 
p421
V Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials,   why didn't you tell me about her voice?  
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V I didn't notice the voice.  
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V It's mellifluous!  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V So, Saturday night.  
p431
tp432
a(V GEORGE 
p433
V She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great   performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have   two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.   Elaine enters.  
p434
tp435
a(V ELAINE 
p436
V Hi.  
p437
tp438
a(V GEORGE 
p439
V Hey! Saturday night!  
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V I know!  
p443
tp444
a(V GEORGE 
p445
V So, what did she say?  
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V She said you're getting together Saturday night!   
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V That's it?  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V Yeah!  
p455
tp456
a(V GEORGE 
p457
V She didn't mention anything about the conversation?   
p458
tp459
a(V ELAINE 
p460
V No.  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great   conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?   
p464
tp465
a(V ELAINE 
p466
V What?  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V She could have mentioned the conversation.    
p470
tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.    Kramer enters.  
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V Hey.  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V Hey.  
p479
tp480
a(V KRAMER 
p481
V You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Oh, the guy from Jersey?  
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this,   he gave me a gross.  
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V What are you gonna do with all of them?    
p491
tp492
a(V KRAMER 
p493
V Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.   
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.   
p497
tp498
a(V KRAMER 
p499
V Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.    
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.   
p503
tp504
a(V GEORGE 
p505
V I'll take one. It's possible.    Mid-episode monologue.   The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a   secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up   to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in   the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving   cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a   nice day." "You too."     Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.   
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back   by now, what did they do?  
p509
tp510
a(V ELAINE 
p511
V I think they went out to dinner.  
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V Wait, I got another call. That must be him. (clicks over) Hello?   
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Yeah, it's me, I just got home.  
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V Oh, hold on. (clicks back) It's George, he just got home.   
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.   
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.   
p527
tp528
a(V ELAINE 
p529
V Remember our pact. Full disclosure.    
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Of course. (clicks back to George) Yeah, go ahead.   
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we   swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.  
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V You can tell me, I'll vault it.  
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V It's in the vault?  
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V I'm locking the vault. What?  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V We had sex.  
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?   
p551
tp552
a(V GEORGE 
p553
V I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.   
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V At your apartment?  
p557
tp558
a(V GEORGE 
p559
V Yeah.  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V She didn't stay over?  
p563
tp564
a(V GEORGE 
p565
V No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine.   Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.   Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.  
p566
tp567
a(V ELAINE 
p568
V Oh my god.  
p569
tp570
a(V CYNTHIA 
p571
V He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would    perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the   most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.  
p572
tp573
a(V ELAINE 
p574
V So? How was it?  
p575
tp576
a(V CYNTHIA 
p577
V How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.   
p578
tp579
a(V ELAINE 
p580
V Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.   
p581
tp582
a(V CYNTHIA 
p583
V Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.    
p584
tp585
a(V ELAINE 
p586
V Yeah, ok. (clicks over) Hello?  
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V So, what did she have to say?  
p590
tp591
a(V ELAINE 
p592
V What did he have to say?  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V He said they had a good time.  
p596
tp597
a(V ELAINE 
p598
V Her too.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V Oh, good.  
p602
tp603
a(V ELAINE 
p604
V Anything else?  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Nope. You?  
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V Nope.  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V You sure?  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V Yup. You?  
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V Yeah.  
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.   
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V Yeah. Okay then.  
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V Alright. Goodnight.  
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V Goodnight.     Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment.  
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with   me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a   person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.    
p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V Well, I'm gonna do something about this.    
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V What are you gonna do?  
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor   like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever.   She's not going to get away with this.  
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE 
p646
V I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was   smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I   could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.    
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V I'm gonna call her.  
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V No, don't call her.  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V No, I'm calling her.  
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V No, Jerry, don't call.  
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V No, forget it, I'm gonna call.  
p662
tp663
a(V GEORGE 
p664
V I don't want you to call.  
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.    
p668
tp669
a(V GEORGE 
p670
V Give me the phone!  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?   
p674
tp675
a(V GEORGE 
p676
V Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!   Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.  
p677
tp678
a(V KRAMER 
p679
V Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!   
p680
tp681
a(V JERRY 
p682
V I'll just call her when you leave!    
p683
tp684
a(V GEORGE 
p685
V You can't do that, it's none of your business!   
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V It is so my business!  
p689
tp690
a(V KRAMER 
p691
V Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of   you!   
p692
tp693
a(V GEORGE 
p694
V But tell him to give me the--  
p695
tp696
a(V KRAMER 
p697
V Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says   something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this   is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?  
p698
tp699
a(V GEORGE 
p700
V No.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V Yeah, but--  
p704
tp705
a(V KRAMER 
p706
V Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They    play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.   
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V But Kramer--  
p710
tp711
a(V KRAMER 
p712
V Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are   plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.   Jerry and George shake hands.  
p713
tp714
a(V KRAMER 
p715
V Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean,   you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you   know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.    
p716
tp717
a(V GEORGE 
p718
V What?  
p719
tp720
a(V KRAMER 
p721
V Right.  
p722
tp723
a(V GEORGE 
p724
V Defective?!  
p725
tp726
a(V KRAMER 
p727
V Defective.  
p728
tp729
a(V GEORGE 
p730
V How could you give me a defective condom?!    
p731
tp732
a(V KRAMER 
p733
V I didn't even know they were defective.     Jerry gets between them to break up the fight.  
p734
tp735
a(V KRAMER 
p736
V Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.   
p737
tp738
a(V GEORGE 
p739
V What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!   
p740
tp741
a(V JERRY 
p742
V Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if   anything was wrong she would have called you already!     Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia.  
p743
tp744
a(V CYNTHIA 
p745
V I missed my period.  
p746
tp747
a(V ELAINE 
p748
V Oh my god.  
p749
tp750
a(V CYNTHIA 
p751
V I am very worried, I am never late.    
p752
tp753
a(V ELAINE 
p754
V But he used a condom, right?  
p755
tp756
a(V CYNTHIA 
p757
V I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.   
p758
tp759
a(V ELAINE 
p760
V Oh no.  
p761
tp762
a(V CYNTHIA 
p763
V What?  
p764
tp765
a(V ELAINE 
p766
V Was it blue?  
p767
tp768
a(V CYNTHIA 
p769
V Yeah. How'd you know?  
p770
tp771
a(V ELAINE 
p772
V Just a hunch.     Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.  
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!    Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.  
p776
tp777
a(V JERRY 
p778
V Oh, hi. Soda?  
p779
tp780
a(V ELAINE 
p781
V No thanks.  
p782
tp783
a(V JERRY 
p784
V So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She   doesn't return calls?  
p785
tp786
a(V ELAINE 
p787
V Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's   good and ready. You don't even know her.  
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V Oh, I know her. I know her type.  
p791
tp792
a(V ELAINE 
p793
V Her type? What type?  
p794
tp795
a(V JERRY 
p796
V The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done   this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!  
p797
tp798
a(V ELAINE 
p799
V You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!   
p800
tp801
a(V JERRY 
p802
V I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.   
p803
tp804
a(V ELAINE 
p805
V She's not bitter!  
p806
tp807
a(V JERRY 
p808
V Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!   
p809
tp810
a(V ELAINE 
p811
V Twisted? God, I did you a favor.  
p812
tp813
a(V JERRY 
p814
V I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're   keeping from me?  
p815
tp816
a(V ELAINE 
p817
V Are you calling me a liar?  
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?   
p821
tp822
a(V ELAINE 
p823
V Are you?  
p824
tp825
a(V JERRY 
p826
V Get your finger out of my face.  
p827
tp828
a(V ELAINE 
p829
V You get yours out, I was here first!    
p830
tp831
a(V JERRY 
p832
V I don't care.  
p833
tp834
a(V ELAINE 
p835
V Get it out!   Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets   in the middle.  
p836
tp837
a(V KRAMER 
p838
V Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the   matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I   mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking   for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right   here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way,   when you see George give him these, these'll work.  
p839
tp840
a(V ELAINE 
p841
V I knew those condoms were defective!    
p842
tp843
a(V JERRY 
p844
V How did you know they were defective?!     George walks in.  
p845
tp846
a(V ELAINE 
p847
V Because! Because she missed her period!    
p848
tp849
a(V GEORGE 
p850
V She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father!   I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!   George rushes out, hysterical.     Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.  
p851
tp852
a(V CYNTHIA 
p853
V So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he   tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and   that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever   way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.  
p854
tp855
a(V ELAINE 
p856
V Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.   
p857
tp858
a(V CYNTHIA 
p859
V I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."   And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--   George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.  
p860
tp861
a(V ELAINE 
p862
V Hi!  
p863
tp864
a(V GEORGE 
p865
V Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.   
p866
tp867
a(V ELAINE 
p868
V What happened?  
p869
tp870
a(V JERRY 
p871
V Acting.  
p872
tp873
a(V ELAINE 
p874
V Very mature.  
p875
tp876
a(V JERRY 
p877
V Thank you. Hi Cynthia.  
p878
tp879
a(V CYNTHIA 
p880
V Hi.  
p881
tp882
a(V JERRY 
p883
V Well this is a great place to sit you got here.   
p884
tp885
a(V CYNTHIA 
p886
V Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the   kitchen.  
p887
tp888
a(V GEORGE 
p889
V Stop it, stop it.  
p890
tp891
a(V JERRY 
p892
V So what are these?  
p893
tp894
a(V ELAINE 
p895
V Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.    George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea   that the relationship has just ended.  
p896
tp897
a.
