Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know    keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost    the Zest."   ....rejects the transplant with organs.   Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant .
