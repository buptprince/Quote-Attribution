V  THE STRANDED  Written by Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld & Matt Goldman     (Comedy club)   So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication. You   ever try and pick one of these out? It's not easy. It's a wall. It's an   entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright,   alright, alright, okay, what the hell-- This is quick acting, but this is long   lasting. When do I need to feel good, now or later?" It's a tough question.   And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong   with the guy, you know? They always show you, like, all the problems that he's   having. First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this   guy. No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public. And he's   always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him   or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him.   I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?" "Yes I am." "Are   you having any lightning with the pain?"    First scene. Jerry and George are in a drug store.   How did you get fleas?  
p2
tp3
a(V GEORGE 
p4
V Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they   got in his carpet.  
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.   
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?   
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The    whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from   Manhattan for this?"  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V You know Ava's gonna be there.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V Who?  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V The nice one that works in my office.    
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V Nah.  
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V I'll drive.  
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Oh, well, now you're talking.  
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V It's supposed to be a good party.  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V What does that mean, good dip?  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V No, there'll be girls there.  
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in    the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between   these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got   propylparabin?  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V Got it.  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V You got isobutane-30?  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V I got isobutane-20.  
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V A-ha.  
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V You got sorbitant sesquioliate?  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V Got it.  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V I have aloe!  
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V You got aloe? I love aloe.  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Where do they make yours?  
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V Jersey.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V White Plains.   George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" box from Jerry   and they go to the check out counter. Two women are standing at the magazine   rack in the background.  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one    over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be   girls out there. What's the matter?  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.   
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.    
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you   only actually gave me change for a ten.  
p92
tp93
a(V CASHIER 
p94
V You gave me a ten.  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V I'm positive I gave you a twenty.  
p98
tp99
a(V CASHIER 
p100
V I know what you gave me.  
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V You owe me ten dollars.  
p104
tp105
a(V CASHIER 
p106
V Will you please step aside? Next?    
p107
tp108
a(V GEORGE 
p109
V Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this   situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my   wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--  
p110
tp111
a(V CASHIER 
p112
V You.  
p113
tp114
a(V GEORGE 
p115
V No, no, no, see you're not really listening.     SECURITY GUARD  What's the problem here?  
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's   all.  
p119
tp120
a(V CASHIER 
p121
V He's claiming short.   SECURITY GUARD  Alright, let's just take it outside.    
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V Oh, so you don't believe me either?     SECURITY GUARD  Come on, let's go.  
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do   you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's   happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't   worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.     New scene. George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door  .   
p128
tp129
a(V ELAINE 
p130
V Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.   
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V No, let's survey first. Camp here.    
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Eva.   A beautiful woman starts walking over.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of    strangers treat your house like a hotel room.  
p140
tp141
a(V AVA 
p142
V So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.    
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?  
p146
tp147
a(V AVA 
p148
V Yesterday  
p149
tp150
a(V GEORGE 
p151
V I don't believe it.  
p152
tp153
a(V AVA 
p154
V Ask Mark.  
p155
tp156
a(V GEORGE 
p157
V Mark, is this true?   A man across the room nods. George and Ava walk towards him.    
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.   
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my   mind.  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us    gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so   the other one can get us out of it.  
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V How old are you?  
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no,   no, I got a better one. Head patting.  
p173
tp174
a(V ELAINE 
p175
V Whatever you want.    Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.    
p176
tp177
a(V GUY 
p178
V You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?   
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Yeah, yeah I did.  
p182
tp183
a(V GUY 
p184
V So what do you do?  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V I'm a comedian.  
p188
tp189
a(V GUY 
p190
V Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?   
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V I hear a voice.  
p194
tp195
a(V GUY 
p196
V What kind of voice?  
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.   
p200
tp201
a(V GUY 
p202
V How come you keep tapping your head.    
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.     Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.   
p206
tp207
a(V GUY 
p208
V On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man    devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for   something.   Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.  
p209
tp210
a(V GUY 
p211
V Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.    Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'. She's still tapping madly.    
p212
tp213
a(V GUY 
p214
V I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.   
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V Yeah, me too.  
p218
tp219
a(V GUY 
p220
V Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.    Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V How's it going?  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Great, how about you?  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off   me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V How do you account for this?  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.   
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Well, she obviously liked you all along.    
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes    me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I   wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them,   then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must   have something going for him."  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Anyway, I'm ready to go.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V Now?  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V If not now, when?  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Gimme a half-hour.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V Okay, half-hour.   Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'. By now, she's weary from tapping.   
p257
tp258
a(V GUY 
p259
V Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Can I talk to you for a second?  
p263
tp264
a(V ELAINE 
p265
V Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing,    I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.   
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V Hey, I was dying over there.  
p269
tp270
a(V ELAINE 
p271
V This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.    Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.  
p272
tp273
a(V ELLEN 
p274
V Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of every   day things, right?  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V Right.  
p278
tp279
a(V ELLEN 
p280
V Yeah, I remember you.   Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch   near a pretentious woman.  
p281
tp282
a(V WOMAN 
p283
V I wonder what happened to my fiancé. I know he's here somewhere.   Ellen? Have you seen my fiancé?  
p284
tp285
a(V ELLEN 
p286
V He's upstairs.  
p287
tp288
a(V WOMAN 
p289
V Are you going upstairs? Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him. I have   lost my fiancé, the poor baby.  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V Maybe the dingo ate your baby.  
p293
tp294
a(V WOMAN 
p295
V What?  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V The dingo ate your baby!   Cut to George and Jerry.  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V You ready?  
p302
tp303
a(V GEORGE 
p304
V Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.   
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V I do favors.  
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V I think something's happening here.    
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V What?  
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V I think she wants me to take her home.    
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Wow.  
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V What should I do?  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Go! What could you do?  
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V What about you and Elaine?  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V We'll get a ride.  
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V Are you sure?  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V We'll be fine, what did she say?  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs   passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.  
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V What? She said that?  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V Yeah.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V Get out of here.  
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V I swear.  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V What did you say?  
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V I, I, I can't.  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V What did you say?  
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V Please, it's--  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V What?  
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V I... I... I long for you.  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V I long for you?  
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.   
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V It's okay, that's not bad.  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating.   The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.   
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Really?  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus?    What if I can't deliver?  
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Oh, come on.  
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for   money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you   imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should   cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V George, you're thinking too much.  
p398
tp399
a(V GEORGE 
p400
V I know, I know, I can't stop it!   Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.  
p401
tp402
a(V ELAINE 
p403
V Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.   
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V Pendant? Those bastards.  
p407
tp408
a(V ELAINE 
p409
V Excuse me.  
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office   
p413
tp414
a(V ELAINE 
p415
V Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?   
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Uh, no, he's taking the car.  
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?    
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V I don't know.  
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V You don't know?  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.  
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?   
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.     Mid-episode monologue   All plans between men are tentative. If one man should suddenly have an   opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other   ever in life. This is the male code. And it doesn't matter how important the   arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle   mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch   pad. They hold that countdown. He's leaning against the rocket talking to her,   "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"    
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing.   You see what she's wearing?  
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V Yeah, yeah, alright.  
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V I can't believe she's walking around in that.   
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V Just don't make a scene.  
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Hey, is that real fur?  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V Oh boy.  
p455
tp456
a(V EVA 
p457
V It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.   
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Yeah, good night.  
p461
tp462
a(V ELAINE 
p463
V You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so   that you can look good?  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE 
p466
V Could we talk about this some other time?   
p467
tp468
a(V AVA 
p469
V Are you a vegetarian?  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Here we go.  
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.  
p476
tp477
a(V AVA 
p478
V So you're a hypocrite.  
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-   
p482
tp483
a(V AVA 
p484
V Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.   
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Fish don't feel any pain.  
p488
tp489
a(V AVA 
p490
V How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?   
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V Well, they're not kept in little cages.    
p494
tp495
a(V AVA 
p496
V Ever seen a goldfish?  
p497
tp498
a(V GEORGE 
p499
V Goldfish.  
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.   
p503
tp504
a(V AVA 
p505
V Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down    the toilet, that's a good life. (To George) Let's go.  
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a   squirrel!  
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V That's why we're here in America.  
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V You're beautiful.  
p515
tp516
a(V ELAINE 
p517
V Call Kramer.  
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?   
p521
tp522
a(V STEVE 
p523
V No, I just live here.  
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Can I use your phone?  
p527
tp528
a(V STEVE 
p529
V What's in it for me?  
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V A bigger bill?  
p533
tp534
a(V STEVE 
p535
V He he, go for it.   Jerry picks up the phone and dials.  
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long   Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't   leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.     Cut to several hours later. The party has ended. The hosts, Steve and Jenny,   are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.  
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V You sure you don't need any help?  
p542
tp543
a(V JENNY 
p544
V No, not really.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V I'm sure he'll be here any minute.    
p548
tp549
a(V JENNY 
p550
V I want them out of here.  
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V Call him again.  
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.   
p557
tp558
a(V JENNY 
p559
V It's two o'clock in the morning.  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw    some of that show, it was wonderful.  
p563
tp564
a(V ELAINE 
p565
V Six hundred and twenty million people died.   
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Thousand.  
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror.   (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the   right directions?  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?   
p575
tp576
a(V JENNY 
p577
V No! (To Steve) I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is   ridiculous.  
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike   Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.   
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for   some reason.  
p584
tp585
a(V JENNY 
p586
V You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.   
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V Oh, he's coming.  
p590
tp591
a(V JENNY 
p592
V Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.    Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.    
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V That's him.  
p596
tp597
a(V JENNY 
p598
V I'm going to bed!  
p599
tp600
a(V ELAINE 
p601
V Thanks a lot.  
p602
tp603
a(V JERRY 
p604
V Thanks, great party.   As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.   
p605
tp606
a(V KRAMER 
p607
V Hey, how ya doing?  
p608
tp609
a(V STEVE 
p610
V Ah, look who's here.  
p611
tp612
a(V KRAMER 
p613
V I'm sorry.  
p614
tp615
a(V JERRY 
p616
V Hey, it's okay.  
p617
tp618
a(V KRAMER 
p619
V I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the   window.  
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V Then how did you find the place?  
p623
tp624
a(V KRAMER 
p625
V Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that   the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on   everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo.   Finally, I hit it. 8173.  
p626
tp627
a(V JERRY 
p628
V Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you    one.  
p629
tp630
a(V STEVE 
p631
V No problem.  
p632
tp633
a(V JERRY 
p634
V And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy    club, whatever.  
p635
tp636
a(V STEVE 
p637
V Hey, I might take you up on that.  
p638
tp639
a(V JERRY 
p640
V Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.   
p641
tp642
a(V KRAMER 
p643
V You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the   convertible up.  
p644
tp645
a(V ELAINE 
p646
V But it's cold out.  
p647
tp648
a(V KRAMER 
p649
V Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.      New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.  
p650
tp651
a(V JERRY 
p652
V George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour,   forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will   get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down   there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.    Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.   
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V Who is it?  
p656
tp657
a(V VOICE 
p658
V Mr. Pocatello.  
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V Who?  
p662
tp663
a(V VOICE 
p664
V You mean you don't recognize my voice?     Jerry opens the door. Steve steps in.  
p665
tp666
a(V STEVE 
p667
V Jerry, baby!  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V Do I know you?  
p671
tp672
a(V STEVE 
p673
V Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.   
p674
tp675
a(V JERRY 
p676
V I'm sorry, uh-  
p677
tp678
a(V STEVE 
p679
V See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.   
p680
tp681
a(V JERRY 
p682
V Oh, okay.  
p683
tp684
a(V STEVE 
p685
V You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.   
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V You certainly are. What's going on?    
p689
tp690
a(V STEVE 
p691
V I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until    eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like   to hang out with someone in show business.  
p692
tp693
a(V JERRY 
p694
V Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.   
p695
tp696
a(V STEVE 
p697
V Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.   
p698
tp699
a(V JERRY 
p700
V No, really, I just got off the phone with him.   
p701
tp702
a(V STEVE 
p703
V I understand.  
p704
tp705
a(V JERRY 
p706
V Look, you can hang out here if you want.    
p707
tp708
a(V STEVE 
p709
V Don't be so enthusiastic.  
p710
tp711
a(V JERRY 
p712
V No, it's-  
p713
tp714
a(V STEVE 
p715
V I'm not gonna steal anything.  
p716
tp717
a(V JERRY 
p718
V No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.   
p719
tp720
a(V STEVE 
p721
V I think I can do that.  
p722
tp723
a(V JERRY 
p724
V Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.    
p725
tp726
a(V STEVE 
p727
V Yeah. Let's have lunch.    New scene. Jerry and George are at the drug store.  
p728
tp729
a(V JERRY 
p730
V They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I   never should have gone.  
p731
tp732
a(V GEORGE 
p733
V Yeah, me either.  
p734
tp735
a(V JERRY 
p736
V Oh, come on.  
p737
tp738
a(V GEORGE 
p739
V What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?    
p740
tp741
a(V JERRY 
p742
V I've never had a job.  
p743
tp744
a(V GEORGE 
p745
V You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day   now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.  
p746
tp747
a(V JERRY 
p748
V That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?   
p749
tp750
a(V GEORGE 
p751
V Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a   friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her.   Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter.   I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze   how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the   rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all   so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there   again.'  
p752
tp753
a(V JERRY 
p754
V What are you gonna do?  
p755
tp756
a(V GEORGE 
p757
V I have no choice, I'm quitting.    Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV. Kramer walks in   and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.  
p758
tp759
a(V KRAMER 
p760
V The party, Long Island?  
p761
tp762
a(V STEVE 
p763
V Kramer, right?  
p764
tp765
a(V KRAMER 
p766
V Hey, what are you doing here?  
p767
tp768
a(V STEVE 
p769
V I'm waiting for my ride.  
p770
tp771
a(V KRAMER 
p772
V Where's Jerry?  
p773
tp774
a(V STEVE 
p775
V He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here    or is that, like, a stupid question?  
p776
tp777
a(V KRAMER 
p778
V Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's   disappointment) Well, but I might have something.   Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore. Jerry is selecting medication.   
p779
tp780
a(V JERRY 
p781
V Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.   
p782
tp783
a(V GEORGE 
p784
V How much is that?  
p785
tp786
a(V JERRY 
p787
V Nine sixty.  
p788
tp789
a(V GEORGE 
p790
V Nine sixty? Give it to me.  
p791
tp792
a(V JERRY 
p793
V Why?  
p794
tp795
a(V GEORGE 
p796
V Don't worry, I got it.  
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V What do you mean, you got it?  
p800
tp801
a(V GEORGE 
p802
V I got it.   George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket.  
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're   stealing this, aren't you?  
p806
tp807
a(V GEORGE 
p808
V I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.   
p809
tp810
a(V JERRY 
p811
V You're a lunatic.  
p812
tp813
a(V GEORGE 
p814
V I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.   
p815
tp816
a(V JERRY 
p817
V What do you say to a person like you?    
p818
tp819
a(V GEORGE 
p820
V Just walk.  
p821
tp822
a(V JERRY 
p823
V Oh.   A security guard approaches George.   SECURITY GUARD  Scuse me. What do you got there?  
p824
tp825
a(V GEORGE 
p826
V What?   SECURITY GUARD  What do you got in your shirt?  
p827
tp828
a(V GEORGE 
p829
V Oh, I was gonna pay for this.   SECURITY GUARD   Come with me.  
p830
tp831
a(V GEORGE 
p832
V Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.   
p833
tp834
a(V CASHIER 
p835
V um-hmm.   SECURITY GUARD  You don't think I remember you?  
p836
tp837
a(V GEORGE 
p838
V What are you talking about?   SECURITY GUARD  I know who you are, I was watching you.    
p839
tp840
a(V GEORGE 
p841
V What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?    The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.    
p842
tp843
a(V JERRY 
p844
V Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?    Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked. Kramer is in the middle   of a story.  
p845
tp846
a(V KRAMER 
p847
V So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the    top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them   turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!   They both erupt in raucous laughter.  
p848
tp849
a(V STEVE 
p850
V Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down)   So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?    
p851
tp852
a(V KRAMER 
p853
V Not really.  
p854
tp855
a(V STEVE 
p856
V Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them   advertised before on the cable station.   Kramer (handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.  
p857
tp858
a(V STEVE 
p859
V Hey, you want in on this?  
p860
tp861
a(V KRAMER 
p862
V No, I got a girl in the next building      New scene. Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's   voice from inside.  
p863
tp864
a(V VOICE 
p865
V Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it. Now I   am through playing games with you, I got things to do.  
p866
tp867
a(V STEVE 
p868
V Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry   
p869
tp870
a(V JERRY 
p871
V What the hell?  
p872
tp873
a(V STEVE 
p874
V Jerry, this is Patti.  
p875
tp876
a(V JERRY 
p877
V Nice to meet you.  
p878
tp879
a(V PATTI 
p880
V It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.   
p881
tp882
a(V JERRY 
p883
V What the hell is going on here?  
p884
tp885
a(V STEVE 
p886
V I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off)   Ooh, there's my ride, finally.  
p887
tp888
a(V PATTI 
p889
V I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.   
p890
tp891
a(V STEVE 
p892
V See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.   
p893
tp894
a(V JERRY 
p895
V Oh, Kramer huh?  
p896
tp897
a(V STEVE 
p898
V Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand    as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out,   we're having another party.   Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.  
p899
tp900
a(V PATTI 
p901
V I ain't leaving.  
p902
tp903
a(V JERRY 
p904
V Patti?  
p905
tp906
a(V PATTI 
p907
V You got anything to drink?  
p908
tp909
a(V JERRY 
p910
V Alright, how much does he owe you?    
p911
tp912
a(V PATTI 
p913
V Fifty dollars.  
p914
tp915
a(V JERRY 
p916
V Fifty dollars.   In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.    
p917
tp918
a(V COP 
p919
V This your apartment?  
p920
tp921
a(V JERRY 
p922
V Yeah, but--  
p923
tp924
a(V COP 
p925
V You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.   
p926
tp927
a(V JERRY 
p928
V Wait a second, I--   Elaine walks in.  
p929
tp930
a(V ELAINE 
p931
V I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?   
p932
tp933
a(V JERRY 
p934
V Oh boy.    New scene. Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.   
p935
tp936
a(V GEORGE 
p937
V You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.  
p938
tp939
a(V JERRY 
p940
V He was a nice guy.  
p941
tp942
a(V GEORGE 
p943
V Oh, great guy.  
p944
tp945
a(V JERRY 
p946
V Was there a red-headed guy there?  
p947
tp948
a(V GEORGE 
p949
V The one with the long sideburns?  
p950
tp951
a(V JERRY 
p952
V Yeah.  
p953
tp954
a(V GEORGE 
p955
V Where does he come off?  
p956
tp957
a(V JERRY 
p958
V Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.   
p959
tp960
a(V GEORGE 
p961
V One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.   
p962
tp963
a.
