V  THE ALTERNATE SIDE  Written by Larry David & Bill Masters     (Comedy club)   Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as   if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it,   it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not   everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice   if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody   tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm   like that.    First scene. Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.   Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.   
p2
tp3
a(V GEORGE 
p4
V Was the alarm on?  
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not   tuned in to it like it's my son.  
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?   
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V They cross the wires or something.    
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.    Kramer enters.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY

V They stole my car.  
p20
tp21
a(V KRAMER 
p22

tp27
a(V KRAMER 
p28
V Was it more than just one?  
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V What should I do, should I call the police?   
p32
tp33
a(V KRAMER 
p34
V What are they gonna do?  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.   
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Maybe you should call your car phone.    
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.   
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE

p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V Are you serious?  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V Yeah, go ahead, call.  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V I don't even know if I remember the number.    Jerry dials.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY

V What do I say if he picks up?   CAR THIEF  Hello?  
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Hello? Is this 555-8383?   CAR THIEF  I have no idea.

tp63
a(V JERRY

V Can I ask you a question?   CAR THIEF  Sure.  
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V Did you steal my car?   CAR THIEF  Yes I did.  
p68

p73
V That's my car!   CAR THIEF  I didn't know it was yours.  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V What are you gonna do with it?   CAR THIEF  I dunno, drive around.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V Then can I have it back?   CAR THIEF  Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.   Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.  
p80
tp81
a(V KRAMER 
p82
V Hello?   CAR THIEF  Yeah, who's this?  
p83
tp84

V Kramer.   CAR THIEF  Hello, Kramer.  
p86
tp87
a(V KRAMER 
p88
V Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.    CAR THIEF  Wait, hold on... Brown ones?  
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my   building, it's 129 West 81st St.   CAR THIEF  One-two-nine, okay.  
p92
tp93
a(V KRAMER 
p94
V Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.  
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?   CAR THIEF  Jerry?  
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?    CAR THIEF  I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.   
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.    CAR THIEF  Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find   the--   Jerry hangs up.  
p104

p109
V Who's Sid?  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.   
p113
tp114
a(V GEORGE 
p115
V What do you mean?  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get   a ticket.  
p119
tp120
a(V GEORGE 
p121
V What, do you pay him for that?  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.  
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V How many people does he do that for?    
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V The whole block, forty, fifty cars.    
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been    doing that for years, right Jerry?  
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Could anybody do that?   Sid enters.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Hey Sid, what happened?  
p140
tp141
a(V SID 
p142
V I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.   
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V You left the keys in the car?  
p146
tp147
a(V SID 
p148
V Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all    those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little   distracted.  
p149
tp150
a(V KRAMER 
p151
V You know I'm in that movie?  
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V You are?  
p155
tp156
a(V KRAMER 
p157
V Yeah, I'm an extra.  
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V How'd you get that?  
p161
tp162
a(V KRAMER 
p163
V Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked    me.  
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V Right out of the clear blue sky?  
p167
tp168
a(V KRAMER 
p169
V Clear blue sky!  
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V Well, why didn't they ask me?  
p173
tp174
a(V KRAMER 
p175
V I got a quality.  
p176
tp177
a(V SID 
p178
V Jerry, you got insurance, right?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.   
p182
tp183
a(V SID 
p184
V Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a    week, so I can't park it.  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V This Wednesday?  
p188
tp189
a(V SID 
p190
V No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.   
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.   
p194
tp195
a(V SID 
p196
V If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the   week after this Wednesday.  
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?   
p200
tp201
a(V SID 
p202
V Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move    themselves if they want.  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V Maybe I could move them until you get back.   
p206
tp207
a(V SID 
p208
V What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V I'm in a transition phase right now.    
p212
tp213
a(V SID 
p214
V Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to   take the keys out, that's all.   Phone rings.  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all   the way over. You're welcome.    New scene. Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.  
p218
tp219
a(V ELAINE 
p220
V I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading    from one of his novels.  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Owen March, I never heard of him.  
p224
tp225
a(V ELAINE 
p226
V Well, he's not a baseball player.  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.   
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.    
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V What's that?  
p236
tp237
a(V ELAINE 
p238
V He's sixty-six years old.   RENTAL CAR AGENT  Next please.  
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V Well, go, go.  
p242
tp243
a(V AGENT 
p244
V Can I help you? Name please?  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm   kidding around, of course.  
p248
tp249
a(V AGENT 
p250
V Okay, let's see here.  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V Sixty-six years old?  
p254
tp255
a(V ELAINE 
p256
V Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd    really like him.  
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?   
p260
tp261
a(V ELAINE 
p262
V What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?   
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant,    she'd be spinning.  
p266
tp267
a(V AGENT 
p268
V I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.   
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?   
p272
tp273
a(V AGENT 
p274
V Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.   
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the   reservation.  
p278
tp279
a(V AGENT 
p280
V I know why we have reservations.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to   take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and   that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody   can just take them.  
p284
tp285
a(V AGENT 
p286
V Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.     The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen   speaking with someone.  
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?    
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V What?  
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking    to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.   
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm    not really saying anything at all?  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought    I was checking with you.  
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.    The agent returns.  
p305
tp306
a(V AGENT 
p307
V I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.   
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.   
p311
tp312
a(V AGENT 
p313
V But we do have a compact if you would like that.   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Fine.  
p317
tp318
a(V AGENT 
p319
V Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you   like insurance?  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell   out of this car.  
p323
tp324
a(V AGENT 
p325
V Please fill this out.  
p326
tp327
a(V ELAINE 
p328
V What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?   
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.   
p332
tp333
a(V ELAINE 
p334
V I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being   with him.    New scene. Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.  
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V I just don't enjoy being with him.    
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Well that's what's important.  
p341
tp342
a(V ELAINE 
p343
V I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to   break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?   
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V How many times you been out with him?    
p347
tp348
a(V ELAINE 
p349
V Seven?  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Face to face.  
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?   
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over   the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.  
p359
tp360
a(V ELAINE 
p361
V Hmm... How's the pasta over there?     Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way   and heads for the kitchen sink.  
p362
tp363
a(V KRAMER 
p364
V Whoa, whoa!!  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V What is going on out there?  
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm    that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I   do?! Help me! Help me!   George runs off into the bathroom.  
p371
tp372
a(V KRAMER 
p373
V Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?   
p374
tp375
a(V ELAINE 
p376
V Today?!  
p377
tp378
a(V KRAMER 
p379
V You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block   carrying this bag of groceries.  
p380
tp381
a(V ELAINE 
p382
V Yeah.  
p383
tp384
a(V KRAMER 
p385
V So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and   Woody, Woody starts laughing.  
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V He was laughing?!  
p389
tp390
a(V KRAMER 
p391
V Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.    
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V So then what?  
p395
tp396
a(V KRAMER 
p397
V I got a line in the movie!  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V Get out!  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V That's great!  
p404
tp405
a(V GEORGE 
p406
V You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?    
p407
tp408
a(V KRAMER 
p409
V Pretty good, huh?  
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?    
p413
tp414
a(V KRAMER 
p415
V Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my   hands, huh?  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V You mean *a* career.  
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V So was Mia Farrow there?  
p422
tp423
a(V KRAMER 
p424
V Uh, I didn't see him.  
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V What's your line?  
p428
tp429
a(V KRAMER 
p430
V Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar   and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?     The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.  
p431
tp432
a(V KRAMER 
p433
V So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go,   "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Is that how you're gonna say it?  
p437
tp438
a(V KRAMER 
p439
V No, no, I'm working on it.  
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."    
p446
tp447
a(V KRAMER 
p448
V No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.   
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"     Jerry pinches his nose.  
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V That was no good?  
p455
tp456
a(V KRAMER 
p457
V I didn't say anything.  
p458
tp459
a(V ELAINE 
p460
V I'm gonna go break up with Owen.  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you   know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long   time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's   parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright!   Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me   thirsty!   George storms out.    New scene. Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry   opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Oh my god.  
p467
tp468
a(V ELAINE 
p469
V Call an ambulance.  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Boy, he took it hard.    New scene. Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.   
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about    to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.    
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west   Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.  
p479
tp480
a(V ELAINE 
p481
V Tell then to hurry! Hurry!  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's   unconscious.   Kramer enters.  
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy,   these pretzels are making me thirsty.  
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V Kramer.  
p491
tp492
a(V KRAMER 
p493
V What happened here?  
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance,   does anyone know first aid?  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?   
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V What extremities?  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V What's an extremity?  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V You raise the feet, get blood to the head.   
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.   
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.   
p515
tp516
a(V JERRY 
p517
V I don't have a washcloth.  
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Well use a paper towel.  
p521
tp522
a(V JERRY 
p523
V You can't put a paper towel on his head.    
p524
tp525
a(V KRAMER 
p526
V What about a big sponge?  
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V How you gonna hold it on there?  
p530
tp531
a(V KRAMER 
p532
V Use a belt.  
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.   
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V Should we walk him around?  
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE AND KRAMER 
p541
V Yes, yes.  
p542
tp543
a(V KRAMER 
p544
V Yeah, I've seen them do that.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V No, no that's for a drug overdose.    
p548
tp549
a(V KRAMER 
p550
V Maybe that's what he's got.  
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the   table.  
p554
tp555
a(V KRAMER 
p556
V Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.   
p557
tp558
a(V ELAINE 
p559
V He is not a drug addict!  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie   or something.  
p563
tp564
a(V ELAINE 
p565
V A cookie!  
p566
tp567
a(V KRAMER 
p568
V Can you give him a cookie?  
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V How's he gonna chew it?  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.    Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.   
p575
tp576
a(V ELAINE 
p577
V Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.   
p578
tp579
a(V KRAMER 
p580
V I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.   
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink   it.  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V Cookies don't liquefy.  
p587
tp588
a(V ELAINE 
p589
V Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.    
p590
tp591
a(V KRAMER 
p592
V Alright I'll get a blender.  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V What blender? I don't have a blender.    
p596
tp597
a(V KRAMER 
p598
V You got a blender.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V I would know if I had a blender.  
p602
tp603
a(V ELAINE 
p604
V Where is the ambulance?!   Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a   crashing sound.   The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five   minutes ago.  
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V I can't believe what's going on out here.   
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)    Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?  
p614
tp615
a(V VOICE 
p616
V Paramedics.  
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V Come on up. Okay, they're here.  
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V He seems to be breathing.  
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.   
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V I know.  
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?   
p632
tp633
a(V ELAINE 
p634
V Almost.  
p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.   
p638
tp639
a(V ELAINE 
p640
V It's not an easy thing to bring up.    
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V Yeah, that's true.  
p644
tp645
a(V ELAINE 
p646
V Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.   
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.   
p650
tp651
a(V ELAINE 
p652
V He does, how'd you know that?  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V I could tell.   Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.  
p656
tp657
a(V ELAINE 
p658
V What happened, what took you so long?!    
p659
tp660
a(V PARAMEDIC 
p661
V We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole   intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we   make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into   us with a blue Escort.  
p662
tp663
a(V JERRY 
p664
V Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!     George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.  
p665
tp666
a(V GEORGE 
p667
V Oh man.  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V What happened to the car?  
p671
tp672
a(V GEORGE 
p673
V Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen)   Who's he?  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V This guy I'm seeing.  
p677
tp678
a(V GEORGE 
p679
V What happened?  
p680
tp681
a(V JERRY 
p682
V We don't know!  
p683
tp684
a(V PARAMEDIC 
p685
V Who put cookies in his mouth?  
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY AND ELAINE 
p688
V Cookies?  
p689
tp690
a(V PARAMEDIC 
p691
V You're not supposed to do that.  
p692
tp693
a(V JERRY 
p694
V So how'd you hit the car?  
p695
tp696
a(V GEORGE 
p697
V I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen   and I got all distracted.  
p698
tp699
a(V JERRY 
p700
V It's not even my car, it's a rental.     Kramer enters.  
p701
tp702
a(V KRAMER 
p703
V What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the   movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.  
p704
tp705
a(V GEORGE 
p706
V Woody mentioned me? What did he say?    
p707
tp708
a(V KRAMER 
p709
V He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all   screwed up?'  
p710
tp711
a(V GEORGE 
p712
V Should I apologize to Woody?  
p713
tp714
a(V KRAMER 
p715
V Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring   it up. I'll feel him out.    Mid-episode Monologue. What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You   know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment.   Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid.   They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we   can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did   you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'     New scene. Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.  
p716
tp717
a(V SID 
p718
V Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have   mentioned that.  
p719
tp720
a(V GEORGE 
p721
V Well I know how to drive.  
p722
tp723
a(V SID 
p724
V Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up   screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.  
p725
tp726
a(V JERRY 
p727
V Can I get anybody anything?  
p728
tp729
a(V SID 
p730
V Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more   sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your   pants on?  
p731
tp732
a(V GEORGE 
p733
V I put my pants on, Sid.  
p734
tp735
a(V SID 
p736
V I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those    cars.  
p737
tp738
a(V GEORGE 
p739
V Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.   
p740
tp741
a(V SID 
p742
V Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs    surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't   park a few cars.  
p743
tp744
a(V GEORGE 
p745
V Maybe I could call my father.   Kramer enters holding a newspaper.  
p746
tp747
a(V KRAMER 
p748
V Hey, you seen the paper yet?  
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.   
p752
tp753
a(V KRAMER 
p754
V Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.    Jerry (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke   yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.  
p755
tp756
a(V KRAMER 
p757
V Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.   
p758
tp759
a(V JERRY 
p760
V The extent of the damage would have been far less severe   had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.  
p761
tp762
a(V SID 
p763
V Oh lord.  
p764
tp765
a(V JERRY 
p766
V The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie   that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said   that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting   movies in New York were over.    New scene. Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of   pretzels.  
p767
tp768
a(V ELAINE 
p769
V Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with   him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'   
p770
tp771
a(V JERRY 
p772
V Can he communicate?  
p773
tp774
a(V ELAINE 
p775
V Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy    it when I read to him.  
p776
tp777
a(V JERRY 
p778
V Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before,   uh, my car got smashed.  
p779
tp780
a(V ELAINE 
p781
V So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll   look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from   the community.  
p782
tp783
a(V JERRY 
p784
V What community? There's a community?    
p785
tp786
a(V ELAINE 
p787
V Of course there's a community.  
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.   
p791
tp792
a(V AGENT 
p793
V Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred    and sixty-six dollars.  
p794
tp795
a(V JERRY 
p796
V Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...   
p797
tp798
a(V AGENT 
p799
V Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of   the car at the time of the accident.  
p800
tp801
a(V JERRY 
p802
V That is right, somebody else was driving.    
p803
tp804
a(V AGENT 
p805
V Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.   
p806
tp807
a(V JERRY 
p808
V Uh huh, what's that?  
p809
tp810
a(V AGENT 
p811
V You're not covered for other drivers.    
p812
tp813
a(V JERRY 
p814
V Other drivers?  
p815
tp816
a(V AGENT 
p817
V Um hm.  
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car.   That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or   something?  
p821
tp822
a(V AGENT 
p823
V Not that particular one.  
p824
tp825
a(V JERRY 
p826
V Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you    want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.  
p827
tp828
a(V AGENT 
p829
V Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--    
p830
tp831
a(V JERRY 
p832
V Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of   Independence, who's gonna read that?  
p833
tp834
a(V AGENT 
p835
V Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that   damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.   
p836
tp837
a(V JERRY 
p838
V These pretzels are making me thirsty.      New scene. Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in   generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup.  
p839
tp840
a(V ELAINE 
p841
V Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't   they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are   they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee   Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I   think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we*   could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh,   feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff.   Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this   point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one   person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I   like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um,   well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here.   It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the   double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These   pretzels are making me thirsty.    New scene. Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.    
p842
tp843
a(V ELAINE 
p844
V Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a   vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?    
p845
tp846
a(V JERRY 
p847
V An overdose of odor? Good question.    
p848
tp849
a(V GEORGE 
p850
V Do I smell?  
p851
tp852
a(V ELAINE 
p853
V No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today,    it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.  
p854
tp855
a(V JERRY 
p856
V Ahh.  
p857
tp858
a(V GEORGE 
p859
V He's alright?  
p860
tp861
a(V ELAINE 
p862
V Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for   sex.   The waitress brings the check.  
p863
tp864
a(V JERRY 
p865
V Let me get that.  
p866
tp867
a(V GEORGE 
p868
V No no no, I got it.  
p869
tp870
a(V JERRY 
p871
V Please.  
p872
tp873
a(V GEORGE 
p874
V No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two   thousand dollars,  
p875
tp876
a(V JERRY 
p877
V Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.     Kramer enters and sits down.  
p878
tp879
a(V JERRY 
p880
V What are you doing here?  
p881
tp882
a(V KRAMER 
p883
V I got fired from the movie.  
p884
tp885
a(V GEORGE 
p886
V Get out of here, why?  
p887
tp888
a(V KRAMER 
p889
V Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it    twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels   are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the   glass down on the bar and it shattered.  
p890
tp891
a(V ELAINE 
p892
V Aww.  
p893
tp894
a(V KRAMER 
p895
V Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And   he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up   to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.    Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.   
p896
