aV  THE HEART ATTACK  Written by Larry Charles     (Night club)   You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have    a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call    my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we    understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin    them whenever I want!   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)   TV VOICE  (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like     flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..     (Jerry's now asleep)   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's bedroom)   (Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing    to himself)   (Scene ends)   (Coffee shop)   (Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)

V ELAINE 
p11
aV You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?    
p12
aa(lp13

V JERRY 
p17
aV (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.    (Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?   
p18
aa(lp19
V ELAINE 
p20
aV No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."

V JERRY 
p23
aV Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?    
p24
aa(lp25
V ELAINE 
p26
aV (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?    
p27
aa(lp28

aa(lp31
V ELAINE 
p32
aV Hey, where's Kramer?  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"   
p36
aa(lp37
V GEORGE 
p38
aV (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.   
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41

p42
aa(lp43

p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV What does that mean?  
p48
aa(lp49
V ELAINE 
p50
aV I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.   
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV Oh, he's having a heart attack.  
p54

p63
aa(lp64

p65
aV Oh, this is ridiculous.  
p66
aa(lp67
V GEORGE 
p68
aV Radiating waves of pain..  
p69
aa(lp70
V JERRY 
p71
aV I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure     and not watch it.  
p72
aa(lp73
V GEORGE 
p74
aV There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.   
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.   
p78
aa(lp79
V GEORGE 
p80
aV Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.   
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?   
p84
aa(lp85
V GEORGE 
p86
aV Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.    
p87
aa(lp88
V JERRY 
p89
aV I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)   (A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)   
p90
aa(lp91
V WAITRESS 
p92
aV Is everything alright?  
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake     on the..  
p96
aa(lp97
V ELAINE 
p98
aV George!   (Scene ends)   (Hospital room)   (George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)

V MAN 
p101
aV Ooohhh... Argghhh..  
p102
aa(lp103
V GEORGE 
p104
aV Are.. are you okay?  
p105
aa(lp106
V MAN 
p107
aV Ooooooohhh..  
p108
aa(lp109
V GEORGE 
p110
aV I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any     ice cream. I always felt that-  
p111
aa(lp112
V MAN 
p113
aV Shut up!   (Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)   
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV Well? What do you think?   NURSE 1  "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.    
p117
aa(lp118
V JERRY 
p119
aV "Salami salami bologna"?  
p120
aa(lp121
V DOCTOR 
p122
aV (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.   
p123
aa(lp124
V JERRY 
p125
aV (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how     ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?   
p126
aa(lp127
V GEORGE 
p128
aV No, no thanks.  
p129
aa(lp130
V JERRY 
p131
aV (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?    
p132
aa(lp133
V GEORGE 
p134
aV Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.   
p135
aa(lp136
V JERRY 
p137
aV Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..   
p138
aa(lp139
V GEORGE 
p140
aV Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.   
p141
aa(lp142
V JERRY 
p143
aV No, I tried it on. It fits good.  
p144
aa(lp145
V GEORGE 
p146
aV Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..   
p147
aa(lp148
V JERRY 
p149
aV Well, you know..  
p150
aa(lp151
V GEORGE 
p152
aV (Reluctantly) Well, okay.  
p153
aa(lp154
V JERRY 
p155
aV Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?   
p156
aa(lp157
V GEORGE 
p158
aV Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..   
p159
aa(lp160
V JERRY 
p161
aV Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.   
p162
aa(lp163
V GEORGE 
p164
aV I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?    
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV You know, if your future was a little more certain..   
p168
aa(lp169
V GEORGE 
p170
aV Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's     end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.   
p171
aa(lp172
V JERRY 
p173
aV Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually     do it)  
p174
aa(lp175
V GEORGE 
p176
aV What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!     (Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)   
p177
aa(lp178
V ELAINE 
p179
aV Jerry!  
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)   
p183
aa(lp184
V GEORGE 
p185
aV (To Jerry) Jerk off.   (Jerry goes over to Elaine)  
p186
aa(lp187
V JERRY 
p188
aV (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.     (They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)   
p189
aa(lp190
V ELAINE 
p191
aV Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?    (Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)   
p192
aa(lp193
V GEORGE 
p194
aV I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my    anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!    (The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)   
p195
aa(lp196
V DOCTOR 
p197
aV (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?   
p198
aa(lp199
V GEORGE 
p200
aV (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.    
p201
aa(lp202
V DOCTOR 
p203
aV Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.   
p204
aa(lp205
V GEORGE 
p206
aV (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!   
p207
aa(lp208
V DOCTOR 
p209
aV And you simply haven't had a heart attack.    
p210
aa(lp211
V GEORGE 
p212
aV (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.   
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?   
p216
aa(lp217
V DOCTOR 
p218
aV No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.   
p219
aa(lp220
V GEORGE 
p221
aV Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.    
p222
aa(lp223
V DOCTOR 
p224
aV Well, I wouldn't go that far.  
p225
aa(lp226
V GEORGE 
p227
aV (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!   
p228
aa(lp229
V DOCTOR 
p230
aV Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?   
p231
aa(lp232
V GEORGE 
p233
aV My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.    
p234
aa(lp235
V DOCTOR 
p236
aV Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.   
p237
aa(lp238
V GEORGE 
p239
aV Really?  
p240
aa(lp241
V ELAINE 
p242
aV (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)   
p243
aa(lp244
V DOCTOR 
p245
aV It happens.  
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.   
p249
aa(lp250
V ELAINE 
p251
aV I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.    
p252
aa(lp253
V DOCTOR 
p254
aV That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.   
p255
aa(lp256
V JERRY 
p257
aV (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.   
p258
aa(lp259
V GEORGE 
p260
aV (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!   
p261
aa(lp262
V DOCTOR 
p263
aV Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.   
p264
aa(lp265
V GEORGE 
p266
aV What? You mean with a knife?  
p267
aa(lp268
V DOCTOR 
p269
aV Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice    cream.  
p270
aa(lp271
V GEORGE 
p272
aV (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.   
p273
aa(lp274
V DOCTOR 
p275
aV Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.   
p276
aa(lp277
V ELAINE 
p278
aV (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)   
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.     (Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food)  
p282
aa(lp283
V KRAMER 
p284
aV Hey.  
p285
aa(lp286
V JERRY 
p287
aV Hey.  
p288
aa(lp289
V KRAMER 
p290
aV Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how    did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.   
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.  
p294
aa(lp295
V KRAMER 
p296
aV The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next     thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.   
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.    
p300
aa(lp301
V KRAMER 
p302
aV No? That's good.  
p303
aa(lp304
V GEORGE 
p305
aV I have to have my tonsils taken out.    
p306
aa(lp307
V KRAMER 
p308
aV Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.   
p309
aa(lp310
V JERRY 
p311
aV (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.   
p312
aa(lp313
V KRAMER 
p314
aV Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a    window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..   
p315
aa(lp316
V GEORGE 
p317
aV Well, what should I do, Kramer?  
p318
aa(lp319
V JERRY 
p320
aV Well, for one think, don't listen to him.   
p321
aa(lp322
V KRAMER 
p323
aV I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just    gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.   
p324
aa(lp325
V JERRY 
p326
aV Eckman? I thought he was doing time?    
p327
aa(lp328
V KRAMER 
p329
aV No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.   
p330
aa(lp331
V JERRY 
p332
aV A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.   
p333
aa(lp334
V KRAMER 
p335
aV He's holistic, George. He's holistic.    
p336
aa(lp337
V GEORGE 
p338
aV Holistic.. that sounds right.  
p339
aa(lp340
V JERRY 
p341
aV George, you need a medical doctor.    
p342
aa(lp343
V GEORGE 
p344
aV (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?   
p345
aa(lp346
V JERRY 
p347
aV Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.    
p348
aa(lp349
V GEORGE 
p350
aV Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?   
p351
aa(lp352
V KRAMER 
p353
aV First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.  
p354
aa(lp355
V GEORGE 
p356
aV Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.    (Scene ends)   (Healer's apartment)   (Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)   
p357
aa(lp358
V GEORGE 
p359
aV So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?   
p360
aa(lp361
V JERRY 
p362
aV Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.    
p363
aa(lp364
V GEORGE 
p365
aV All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm     already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes    in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.   
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY 
p368
aV (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.   
p369
aa(lp370
V GEORGE 
p371
aV Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?    (Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)   
p372
aa(lp373
V TOR 
p374
aV (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?   
p375
aa(lp376
V JERRY 
p377
aV Sorry.   (Tor sits down, and turns tward George)  
p378
aa(lp379
V TOR 
p380
aV What month were you born?  
p381
aa(lp382
V GEORGE 
p383
aV April.  
p384
aa(lp385
V TOR 
p386
aV You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.   
p387
aa(lp388
V GEORGE 
p389
aV Really?  
p390
aa(lp391
V TOR 
p392
aV Do you use hot water in the shower?    
p393
aa(lp394
V GEORGE 
p395
aV Yes.  
p396
aa(lp397
V TOR 
p398
aV Stop using it.  
p399
aa(lp400
V GEORGE 
p401
aV ..Okay.  
p402
aa(lp403
V KRAMER 
p404
aV I'm off hot water.  
p405
aa(lp406
V TOR 
p407
aV Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.   
p408
aa(lp409
V GEORGE 
p410
aV Yes, yes I am.  
p411
aa(lp412
V TOR 
p413
aV (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs    customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.   
p414
aa(lp415
V GEORGE 
p416
aV (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?   
p417
aa(lp418
V TOR 
p419
aV No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain    sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.   
p420
aa(lp421
V JERRY 
p422
aV (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.   
p423
aa(lp424
V GEORGE 
p425
aV (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?   
p426
aa(lp427
V TOR 
p428
aV (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)   
p429
aa(lp430
V GEORGE 
p431
aV I guess so.  
p432
aa(lp433
V TOR
