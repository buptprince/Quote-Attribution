V  THE HEART ATTACK  Written by Larry Charles     (Night club)   You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have    a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call    my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we    understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin    them whenever I want!   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)   TV VOICE  (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like     flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..     (Jerry's now asleep)   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's bedroom)   (Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing    to himself)   (Scene ends)   (Coffee shop)   (Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)

V What do you got, a cucumber?  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V Yeah, so what?  
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?    
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.   
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.    (Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?   
p17
tp18
a(V ELAINE 
p19
V No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."    
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?    
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?    
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Let me see that. (Studies the note)    
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V Hey, where's Kramer?  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"   
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V I don't think that's it.  
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V I'm not kidding.  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V What does that mean?  
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.   
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V Oh, he's having a heart attack.  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V Tightness..  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V C'mon.  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V Shortness of breath..  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Oh, this is ridiculous.  
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V Radiating waves of pain..  
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure     and not watch it.  
p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.   
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.   
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.   
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?   
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.    
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)   (A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)   
p89
tp90
a(V WAITRESS 
p91
V Is everything alright?  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake     on the..  
p95
tp96
a(V ELAINE 
p97
V George!   (Scene ends)   (Hospital room)   (George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)   
p98
tp99
a(V MAN 
p100
V Ooohhh... Argghhh..  
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V Are.. are you okay?  
p104
tp105
a(V MAN 
p106
V Ooooooohhh..  
p107
tp108
a(V GEORGE 
p109
V I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any     ice cream. I always felt that-  
p110
tp111
a(V MAN 
p112
V Shut up!   (Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)   
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Well? What do you think?   NURSE 1  "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.    
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V "Salami salami bologna"?  
p119
tp120
a(V DOCTOR 
p121
V (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.   
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how     ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?   
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V No, no thanks.  
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?    
p131
tp132
a(V GEORGE 
p133
V Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.   
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..   
p137
tp138
a(V GEORGE 
p139
V Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.   
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V No, I tried it on. It fits good.  
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..   
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Well, you know..  
p149
tp150
a(V GEORGE 
p151
V (Reluctantly) Well, okay.  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?   
p155
tp156
a(V GEORGE 
p157
V Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..   
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.   
p161
tp162
a(V GEORGE 
p163
V I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?    
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V You know, if your future was a little more certain..   
p167
tp168
a(V GEORGE 
p169
V Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's     end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.   
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually     do it)  
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!     (Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)   
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Jerry!  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)   
p182
tp183
a(V GEORGE 
p184
V (To Jerry) Jerk off.   (Jerry goes over to Elaine)  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.     (They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)   
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?    (Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)   
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my    anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!    (The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)   
p194
tp195
a(V DOCTOR 
p196
V (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?   
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.    
p200
tp201
a(V DOCTOR 
p202
V Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.   
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!   
p206
tp207
a(V DOCTOR 
p208
V And you simply haven't had a heart attack.    
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?   
p215
tp216
a(V DOCTOR 
p217
V No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.   
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.    
p221
tp222
a(V DOCTOR 
p223
V Well, I wouldn't go that far.  
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!   
p227
tp228
a(V DOCTOR 
p229
V Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?   
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.    
p233
tp234
a(V DOCTOR 
p235
V Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.   
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V Really?  
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)   
p242
tp243
a(V DOCTOR 
p244
V It happens.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.   
p248
tp249
a(V ELAINE 
p250
V I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.    
p251
tp252
a(V DOCTOR 
p253
V That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.   
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.   
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!   
p260
tp261
a(V DOCTOR 
p262
V Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.   
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V What? You mean with a knife?  
p266
tp267
a(V DOCTOR 
p268
V Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice    cream.  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.   
p272
tp273
a(V DOCTOR 
p274
V Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.   
p275
tp276
a(V ELAINE 
p277
V (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)   
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.     (Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food)  
p281
tp282
a(V KRAMER 
p283
V Hey.  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V Hey.  
p287
tp288
a(V KRAMER 
p289
V Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how    did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.   
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.  
p293
tp294
a(V KRAMER 
p295
V The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next     thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.   
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.    
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V No? That's good.  
p302
tp303
a(V GEORGE 
p304
V I have to have my tonsils taken out.    
p305
tp306
a(V KRAMER 
p307
V Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.   
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.   
p311
tp312
a(V KRAMER 
p313
V Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a    window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V Well, what should I do, Kramer?  
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Well, for one think, don't listen to him.   
p320
tp321
a(V KRAMER 
p322
V I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just    gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.   
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Eckman? I thought he was doing time?    
p326
tp327
a(V KRAMER 
p328
V No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.   
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.   
p332
tp333
a(V KRAMER 
p334
V He's holistic, George. He's holistic.    
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V Holistic.. that sounds right.  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V George, you need a medical doctor.    
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?   
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.    
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?   
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.  
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.    (Scene ends)   (Healer's apartment)   (Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)   
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?   
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.    
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm     already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes    in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.   
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?    (Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)   
p371
tp372
a(V TOR 
p373
V (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?   
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V Sorry.   (Tor sits down, and turns tward George)  
p377
tp378
a(V TOR 
p379
V What month were you born?  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V April.  
p383
tp384
a(V TOR 
p385
V You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.   
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V Really?  
p389
tp390
a(V TOR 
p391
V Do you use hot water in the shower?    
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V Yes.  
p395
tp396
a(V TOR 
p397
V Stop using it.  
p398
tp399
a(V GEORGE 
p400
V ..Okay.  
p401
tp402
a(V KRAMER 
p403
V I'm off hot water.  
p404
tp405
a(V TOR 
p406
V Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.   
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V Yes, yes I am.  
p410
tp411
a(V TOR 
p412
V (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs    customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.   
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?   
p416
tp417
a(V TOR 
p418
V No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain    sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.   
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.   
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?   
p425
tp426
a(V TOR 
p427
V (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)   
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V I guess so.  
p431
tp432
a(V TOR 
p433
V (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion     of heat and wind.  
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..   
p437
tp438
a(V TOR 
p439
V You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.   
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442

These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..     (The Doctor is still holding her tongue)
