V  THE NOSE JOB  Written by Peter Mehlman     (Comedy club)   Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half   feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there   on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear   physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half   feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me   some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing   everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on   there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the   typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to   get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm   allowed up here."     First scene.   Jerry and George are at a newsstand.   Where'd you meet her?  
p2
tp3
a(V JERRY 
p4
V I met her on an elevator.  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?   
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Impossible, right?  
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb.    What got into you?  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The    words just came out of my mouth.  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V Wow. What'd you say?   (flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)  
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.    (end of flashback)  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V Wow.  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V Can you believe I did that?  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V What did she say?   (another flashback)  
p32
tp33
a(V ISABEL 
p34
V What crop circles?   (end of flashback)  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V Not a good sign.  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand    owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?   NEWSSTAND OWNER  Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?    
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V You got something in your teeth there.    
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V What?  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V It's green.  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all    afternoon.  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V Did you bump into anybody you knew?    
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V I had a job interview.  
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V How'd it go?  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V Take a guess.   (flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached    teeth.)  
p65
tp66
a(V INTERVIEWER 
p67
V Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time,    but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.  
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Ok, thanks.   (end of flashback)  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V What do you need a job, you got Audrey.    
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V Yeah, right.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V What's the matter?  
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V Oh, nothing.  
p83
tp84
a(V JERRY 
p85
V What?  
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V You won't think I'm a bad person?  
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V Too late for that.  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a    psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.  
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Yeah, she's got a big nose.  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.    (momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V It's a schnoz.  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little    short of perfection.  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V A little.  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be    grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have    to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't    ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell    myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I    look at her, I see nose.  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Stop being so concerned with looks.     (momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Have you said anything to her about it?   
p119
tp120
a(V GEORGE 
p121
V I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a    smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be    out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And    I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V Alright, shut up, here they come.  
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.      New scene.   Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's    apartment.  
p128
tp129
a(V KRAMER 
p130
V So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house    so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he    takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So    Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that    you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.    
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?   
p134
tp135
a(V KRAMER 
p136
V No no, he's never met her. She's in California.   
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V Are you coming with me?  
p140
tp141
a(V KRAMER 
p142
V Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.   
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V Why don't you just commit yourself already?    
p146
tp147
a(V AUDREY 
p148
V What is so special about this jacket?    
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.   
p152
tp153
a(V AUDREY 
p154
V What's the smudge on your hand?  
p155
tp156
a(V KRAMER 
p157
V Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going    back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.   
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V What, you didn't wash all day?  
p161
tp162
a(V KRAMER 
p163
V Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at    this club. Ohh, man.  
p164
tp165
a(V AUDREY 
p166
V It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually    find it kind of intimidating.  
p167
tp168
a(V KRAMER 
p169
V Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.   
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V Kramer!  
p173
tp174
a(V KRAMER 
p175
V What? What?  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V How could you say something like that?!    
p179
tp180
a(V KRAMER 
p181
V What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.   
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.   
p185
tp186
a(V AUDREY 
p187
V No, it's ok.  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V What did you have to say that for?    
p191
tp192
a(V KRAMER 
p193
V Well, I was just trying to help out.    
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINE 
p196
V Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.   
p197
tp198
a(V KRAMER 
p199
V You see what happens when you try to be nice?        Mid-episode monologue.   But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all    the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About    thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok,    your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you    very much."       New scene.   George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment.  
p200
tp201
a(V AUDREY 
p202
V Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back.    What are you thinking about?  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?   
p206
tp207
a(V AUDREY 
p208
V You look like you've got something on your mind.   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause)    So how about that Kramer, huh?  
p212
tp213
a(V AUDREY 
p214
V How about him?  
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V They way he just says stuff.  
p218
tp219
a(V AUDREY 
p220
V He sure does.  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.    
p224
tp225
a(V AUDREY 
p226
V So, what did you think?  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V About the pizza?  
p230
tp231
a(V AUDREY 
p232
V No, about the nose job.  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?   
p236
tp237
a(V AUDREY 
p238
V Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.   
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but    these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined.    And again, I'm not suggesting.  
p242
tp243
a(V AUDREY 
p244
V I know, they're good.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V Peter Jennings had one.  
p248
tp249
a(V AUDREY 
p250
V Really?  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class    had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...  
p254
tp255
a(V AUDREY 
p256
V Uh huh.  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.   
p260
tp261
a(V AUDREY 
p262
V I hate the dentist.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V It's a cleaning.  
p266
tp267
a(V AUDREY 
p268
V So you really think I should do this?    
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you   
p272
tp273
a(V THIS 
p274
V Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone    it, but it's a fact of life.  
p275
tp276
a(V AUDREY 
p277
V Well, maybe I should.  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V What the hell.  
p281
tp282
a(V ELAINE 
p283
V Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?   
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V Me? I didn't say anything.  
p287
tp288
a(V ELAINE 
p289
V You encouraged her to get one.  
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V I didn't encourage. No encourage.  
p293
tp294
a(V ELAINE 
p295
V Peter Jennings had one?  
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V It's possible.  
p299
tp300
a(V ELAINE 
p301
V Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.   
p302
tp303
a(V AUDREY 
p304
V No, George is right. I want to get one.    
p305
tp306
a(V ELAINE 
p307
V I think it's a mistake.  
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.      New scene.   Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.   
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the    bandages off at four o'clock.  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V We have time.  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.   
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V It is exciting.  
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...   
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever    met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so    attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my    penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.  
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.   
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Then what?  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V He still wins but it's not a blowout.    
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting    scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless,    I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.     (flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V I don't want to see this woman anymore but    I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help    me.  
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V I'm proud of you.   (end of flashback)  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.   
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V Good for you.  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was     just completely uninhibited.  
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not    caring.  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V It's not like that at all.     New scene.   Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment.    
p368
tp369
a(V ELAINE 
p370
V How do you even know the jacket is there?    
p371
tp372
a(V KRAMER 
p373
V Well I don't, I'm guessing.  
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that     I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna    be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd    listened to your friend, Elaine,  
p377
tp378
a(V AUDREY 
p379
V George?  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V Yeah?  
p383
tp384
a(V AUDREY 
p385
V Enough.  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.   
p389
tp390
a(V ELAINE 
p391
V Are you sure you want us here for this?    
p392
tp393
a(V AUDREY 
p394
V Yes.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Shouldn't a doctor do it?  
p398
tp399
a(V AUDREY 
p400
V No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.    Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.   
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V It looks good.  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Great job.  
p410
tp411
a(V KRAMER 
p412
V You got butchered.   George faints.   An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.   
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V Let's put him over here.  
p416
tp417
a(V KRAMER 
p418
V Where are you going?  
p419
tp420
a(V AUDREY 
p421
V To the doctor!  
p422
tp423
a(V KRAMER 
p424
V Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.     Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.  
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V How ya feeling?  
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V Too much salt in my diet.  
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Can I get you anything?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Nah, I'm good.  
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V You sure? Anything?  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?   
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V No, it didn't. No, it didn't.  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V It's like, all dented.  
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Seems to be.  
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern    science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be    stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--  
p455
tp456
a(V ELAINE 
p457
V Shut up, George.  
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Shut up?  
p461
tp462
a(V ELAINE 
p463
V Yeah.  
p464
tp465
a(V GEORGE 
p466
V Interesting.     New scene.   Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal,    Jerry has cracked.  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!   
p470
tp471
a(V KRAMER 
p472
V I don't have it, I threw it out.  
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V You're lying! You got it, I want that number!   
p476
tp477
a(V KRAMER 
p478
V I told you, I threw it out.  
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V Give it to me!  
p482
tp483
a(V KRAMER 
p484
V You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.   
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.   
p488
tp489
a(V KRAMER 
p490
V You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.   
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V I was lying, give it to me!  
p494
tp495
a(V KRAMER 
p496
V No, you told me not to!  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY

V I want that number!  
p500
tp501
a(V KRAMER 
p502
V Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah!    Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you!    Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror,    cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it    anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you    destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!   Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl,    then storms out again.     New scene.   George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose,    George is trying not to look at it.  
p503
tp504
a(V AUDREY 
p505
V The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum.    Over here...  
p506
tp507
a(V GEORGE 
p508
V Yeah.  
p509
tp510
a(V AUDREY 
p511
V You see this perinasal sinus cavity?    
p512
tp513
a(V GEORGE 
p514
V Oh, I got it.  
p515
tp516
a(V AUDREY 
p517
V You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.   
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V Yeah, phew.  
p521
tp522
a(V AUDREY 
p523
V So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?   
p524
tp525
a(V GEORGE 
p526
V What?  
p527
tp528
a(V AUDREY 
p529
V Remember we talked about taking a trip together?   
p530
tp531
a(V GEORGE 
p532
V We did?  
p533
tp534
a(V AUDREY 
p535
V Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?    
p536
tp537
a(V GEORGE 
p538
V Hawaii?  
p539
tp540
a(V AUDREY 
p541
V Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.    George (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right    now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's    a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.   
p542
tp543
a(V AUDREY 
p544
V I never heard that.  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V Oh yeah. My friend lived there.  
p548
tp549
a(V AUDREY 
p550
V We could go to the Caribbean.  
p551
tp552
a(V GEORGE 
p553
V You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane    right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he    used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there,    uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you    from going. You could go. I don't mind.  
p554
tp555
a(V AUDREY 
p556
V George, I don't think this is working.       New scene.   Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.  
p557
tp558
a(V ISABEL 
p559
V Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear    Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V I'm Nelson!  
p563
tp564
a(V ISABEL 
p565
V That's not the line, Jerry.  
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just    need more time.  
p569
tp570
a(V ISABEL 
p571
V I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go     crazy thinking about you.  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.   
p575
tp576
a(V ISABEL 
p577
V Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.   
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.       Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess    with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.   JERRY'S BRAIN  Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we    play one for all the marbles?   JERRY'S PENIS  Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have    any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!   JERRY'S BRAIN  I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little    acting scenes.   JERRY'S PENIS  Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up    with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour,    then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.    JERRY'S BRAIN  What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's    like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do    whatever it is you do. You disgust me.   JERRY'S PENIS  Oh, go read a book.   JERRY'S BRAIN  Enough chatting, let's play.     New scene.   Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.  
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to    the hospital.  
p584
tp585
a(V KRAMER 
p586
V Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got    everything?  
p587
tp588
a(V ELAINE 
p589
V Yeah.  
p590
tp591
a(V KRAMER 
p592
V Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.   
p593
tp594
a(V ELAINE 
p595
V What do I need this for?  
p596
tp597
a(V KRAMER 
p598
V Because we're engaged.  
p599
tp600
a(V ELAINE 
p601
V We're engaged?  
p602
tp603
a(V KRAMER 
p604
V Um hm.  
p605
tp606
a(V ELAINE 
p607
V Kramer, this is too big.  
p608
tp609
a(V KRAMER 
p610
V It's my mom's.   A stout man walks around the corner.  
p611
tp612
a(V LANDLORD 
p613
V Hello?  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father    asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.  
p617
tp618
a(V LANDLORD 
p619
V Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And    you must be Professor Von Nostrand?  
p620
tp621
a(V KRAMER 
p622
V Yes, yes I am.  
p623
tp624
a(V LANDLORD 
p625
V I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.   
p626
tp627
a(V KRAMER 
p628
V Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.    
p629
tp630
a(V LANDLORD 
p631
V Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?   
p632
tp633
a(V KRAMER 
p634
V My contention?  
p635
tp636
a(V LANDLORD 
p637
V Yes, your contention.  
p638
tp639
a(V KRAMER 
p640
V Yes, that's my contention.  
p641
tp642
a(V ELAINE 
p643
V I heard him contend that.  
p644
tp645
a(V LANDLORD 
p646
V It's too bad about your father.  
p647
tp648
a(V ELAINE 
p649
V Oh, it was a frame-up.  
p650
tp651
a(V LANDLORD 
p652
V A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work    you're doing.  
p653
tp654
a(V ELAINE 
p655
V Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.   
p656
tp657
a(V KRAMER 
p658
V She does fine work.  
p659
tp660
a(V LANDLORD 
p661
V Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to    anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this    way.  
p662
tp663
a(V ELAINE 
p664
V How kind of you.  
p665
tp666
a(V LANDLORD 
p667
V You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.    Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.       New scene.   Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have    the upper hand.   JERRY'S BRAIN  What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha    ha!  
p668
tp669
a(V ISABEL 
p670
V Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of    you.   JERRY'S PENIS  It's killing me. (Makes a move)   JERRY'S BRAIN  That's your move?   JERRY'S PENIS  Yeah.   JERRY'S BRAIN  Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!    JERRY'S PENIS  Getting weak... Losing   power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing    without me. Nothing!   Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop.   JERRY'S BRAIN  Punk.  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.     Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.     Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment.    
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.   
p677
tp678
a(V LANDLORD 
p679
V He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite     popular with the ladies.  
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V My father, really? I had no idea.  
p683
tp684
a(V LANDLORD 
p685
V Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came    around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been    your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs    Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken    stumblebum.  
p686
tp687
a(V KRAMER 
p688
V You don't say?  
p689
tp690
a(V ELAINE 
p691
V I found it!  
p692
tp693
a(V LANDLORD 
p694
V The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a    can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees,    screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring    back that box of Danish!"   Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated.    Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.     New scene.   The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.  
p695
tp696
a(V KRAMER 
p697
V So I grabbed the guy by the collar.    
p698
tp699
a(V ELAINE 
p700
V Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"   
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V So I assume the jig was up.  
p704
tp705
a(V ELAINE 
p706
V Yeah, pretty much.   Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey    walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful.    
p707
tp708
a(V AUDREY 
p709
V Hi.  
p710
tp711
a(V ELAINE 
p712
V Hi!

p715
V Hey.  
p716
tp717
a(V AUDREY 
p718
V Hello.  
p719
tp720
a(V GEORGE 
p721
V Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!   
p722
tp723
a(V AUDREY 
p724
V Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.    
p725
tp726
a(V ELAINE 
p727
V So, will I see you later tonight?  
p728
tp729
a(V AUDREY 
p730
V Not sure.  
p731
tp732
a(V KRAMER 
p733
V Well, I'll check   you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?  
p734
tp735
a(V AUDREY 
p736
V I didn't wash.  
p737
tp738
a(V KRAMER 
p739
V Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.   
p740
tp741
a(V ELAINE 
p742
V Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect    proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have    though she's like--
