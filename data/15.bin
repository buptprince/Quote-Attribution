V  THE CHINESE RESTAURANT  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Comedy club)   (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call,     hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the    phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them    right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the    street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you    know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah,    operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear    that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"    (Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant)

a(V ELAINE 
p4
V No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as    that.  
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's     much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and    garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.   
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make     it one job, 'cop\u005cgarbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to    do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get    right back to sweeping.  
p11
tp12
a(V ELAINE 
p13
V You should run for mayor.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Ehh, nobody listens.  
p17
tp18
a(V ELAINE 
p19
V Where is someone? I'm starving.  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V I think this is him right here.  
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V Is there a table ready?   RESTAURANT MANAGER  How many?

p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Is Tatiana coming?  
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very    lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V Really? I thought things were going  OK.   
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V They were, it's kinda complicated.    
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Well what is it?  
p44
tp45
a(V ELAINE 
p46
V How many?  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.  
p50
tp51
a(V BRUCE 
p52
V Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V What do you wanna do?  
p56
tp57
a(V ELAINE 
p58
V Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.    
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we    wanna make it to the movie.  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?    
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V Tatiana...   (George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)    
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?     (guy on phone just turns the other way without answering)  
p71
tp72
a(V BRUCE 
p73
V Lashbrook(sp?), 4!  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V So did I do a terrible thing?  
p77
tp78
a(V ELAINE 
p79
V You mean lying to your uncle?  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night    only, the big screen. My hands are tied!  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just    chit-chat.  
p86
tp87
a(V ELAINE 
p88
V Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.   
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.   
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.   
p95
tp96
a(V ELAINE 
p97
V Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?   
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.   
p101
tp102
a(V ELAINE 
p103
V Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.   
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity?    What kind of a world do we live in?   (Jerry stares at someone)  
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V What?  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair,    striped shirt?  
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V I've never seen her before.  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.    (a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)    
p119
tp120
a(V MAN 
p121
V Oh, Excuse me.  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V I'm sorry.   (the group just walks right into the dining room)  
p125
tp126
a(V ELAINE 
p127
V Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V Well maybe they were here from before.    
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V No no no, they weren't here before.    
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a    very important call.   (guy on phone turns away again)  
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V Find out what's going on!  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of     them.  
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V Yeah.  
p146
tp147
a(V BRUCE 
p148
V What's your name?  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Seinfeld.   (Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese)  
p152
tp153
a(V BRUCE 
p154
V No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?),  2!   
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?     They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make    you sick.  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Boy, you are really hungry.  
p161
tp162
a(V GEORGE 
p163
V Hey!   (guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry)   
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V If anything happens here, can I count on you?   
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V What?  
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V If we decide to go at it.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...    
p176
tp177
a(V GEORGE 
p178
V I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit.    It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate    this guy.  
p179
tp180
a(V ELAINE 
p181
V I'm gonna faint...  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V George, who is that woman in the stripes?    
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V I don't know her.  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V She looks so familiar.  
p191
tp192
a(V ELAINE 
p193
V Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It    should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and    taking some food off somebody's plate.  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.   
p197
tp198
a(V ELAINE 
p199
V What do you mean?  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say    anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I    give you 50 bucks.  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V What are they gonna do?  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell    for the rest of their lives.  
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?    
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.   
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and     find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or    something...  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V No, no tricks.  
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V Should I do it, George?  
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.   
p227
tp228
a(V ELAINE 
p229
V Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.    (Elaine goes over to the table, smiling)  
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are    standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of    your eggrolls.   (the people at the table are confused)  
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE 
p235
V I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.     PEOPLE AT TABLE  What? What is she talking about? What did she say?    (Elaine runs from the table, laughing)  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V What happened?  
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V Did you see that?  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V What were you doing?  
p245
tp246
a(V ELAINE 
p247
V I offered them 25, they had no idea...    
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V George, the phone's free.  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Alleluia.   (as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts dialing)   
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Excuse me, I was waiting here.   WOMAN AT PHONE  Where? I didn't see you.  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!   
p260
tp261
a(V WOMAN 
p262
V Well I won't be long.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V That's not the point. The point is I was here first.   
p266
tp267
a(V WOMAN 
p268
V Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.   
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed    to act in a civilized way.   (he goes over to Jerry and Elaine)  
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity     over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!    (guy on phone approaches George)  
p275
tp276
a(V GUY 
p277
V Hey, sorry I took so long.  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.   
p281
tp282
a(V ELAINE 
p283
V How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around,    see what dishes look good.  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?    
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V Yeah, well, he probably bought it.    
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V So what happened with Tatiana?  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V I shouldn't even tell you this.  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Come on...  
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.   
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V I'm with you.  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like    right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove.    You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and    it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this    impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great    lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as    this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily...    extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know    that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm    going to need...  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V This could only happen to you.  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the    wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".  
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V You said this to her after.  
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V No. During.  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Oh, boy.  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Yeah.  
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V Wow! So...?  
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this     unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman,    and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might    possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very    sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her    to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's    (gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.   (Elaine comes over)  
p332
tp333
a(V ELAINE 
p334
V I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back     here again.  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Who is that woman?!  
p338
tp339
a(V ELAINE 
p340
V Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember,    it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never    saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and    exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them    to fill up the trough.  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)   
p344
tp345
a(V ELAINE 
p346
V Jerry, talk to that guy again.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V What am I gonna say?  
p350
tp351
a(V ELAINE 
p352
V Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.    (as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in)   MR. COHEN  Hey, what stinks in here?  
p353
tp354
a(V BRUCE 
p355
V Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.    MR. COHEN  Well, I've been looking for a better place.    (Bruce laughs)  
p356
tp357
a(V BRUCE 
p358
V Better place... Want a table?   MR. COHEN  No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.   
p359
tp360
a(V BRUCE 
p361
V Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a    table.  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that     guy, he just came in.  
p365
tp366
a(V BRUCE 
p367
V Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.  
p368
tp369
a(V ELAINE 
p370
V He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?   
p371
tp372
a(V BRUCE 
p373
V Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.   
p374
tp375
a(V ELAINE 
p376
V Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!   
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those    people wouldn't get off the phone.  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Didja leave a message?  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the    phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm    expecting a call.  
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...    
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Where do I know her?   (woman in stripes approaches Jerry)  
p392
tp393
a(V LORRAINE 
p394
V Hello, Jerry!  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?  
p398
tp399
a(V LORRAINE 
p400
V How is everything?  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Good, good, good... What's goin' on?    
p404
tp405
a(V LORRAINE 
p406
V Oh, working hard. And you?  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.   
p410
tp411
a(V LORRAINE 
p412
V You haven't been around in a while.    
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V I know, I know... Well, you know.  
p416
tp417
a(V LORRAINE 
p418
V You should come by.  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.   
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V Hi, I'm Elaine.  
p425
tp426
a(V LORRAINE 
p427
V Lorraine. Catalano.  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...     (They all laugh, then silent)  
p431
tp432
a(V LORRAINE 
p433
V Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she    leaves)  
p434
tp435
a(V ELAINE 
p436
V Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!    
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in    big, big trouble.  
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V The one you broke the plans with tonight?    
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and    tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna    call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls    this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda    Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt    to my mother, my mother to my uncle...  
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.   
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in    over with. It's just a movie.  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8    from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst    movie ever made!   (Elaine nods)  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a    table immediately.  
p458
tp459
a(V ELAINE 
p460
V Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some    money.  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?   
p464
tp465
a(V ELAINE 
p466
V Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy    who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?  
p470

a(V ELAINE 
p472
V Well what do you want to give him, change?    
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475
V It's more than the meal!  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.   
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!   
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?   
p485
tp486
a(V GEORGE 
p487
V Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered.     Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.   
p488
tp489
a(V ELAINE 
p490
V I guess it's you, Jer.  
p491
tp492
a(V JERRY 
p493
V Me? What about you?  
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.    
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world     of bribery, can they?  
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Give me the money.   (Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)    
p503
tp504
a(V ELAINE 
p505
V How's it going'?  
p506
tp507
a(V BRUCE 
p508
V Very busy.   (Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce)  
p509
tp510
a(V ELAINE 
p511
V Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.    
p512
tp513
a(V BRUCE 
p514
V Very good specials tonight.   (Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book)  
p515
tp516
a(V ELAINE 
p517
V If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate     it.  
p518
tp519
a(V BRUCE 
p520
V What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)   
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)   
p524
tp525
a(V BRUCE 
p526
V Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.   
p527
tp528
a(V ELAINE 
p529
V Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take    it!   (Bruce shrugs and takes it)  
p530
tp531
a(V BRUCE 
p532
V Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.   
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you    see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.   
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V You lost the 20.  
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V Well, how could he do that?  
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V You didn't make it clear.  
p545
tp546
a(V ELAINE 
p547
V Make it clear?  
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.    (goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my    friend here apparently made a mistake.  
p551
tp552
a(V BRUCE 
p553
V Your name?  
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V Seinfeld.  
p557
tp558
a(V BRUCE 
p559
V Yeah, Seinfeld 4!  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?    (Elaine waves at him, smiling)  
p563
tp564
a(V BRUCE 
p565
V Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?   
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant    here.  
p569
tp570
a(V BRUCE 
p571
V Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-   
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?   
p575
tp576
a(V BRUCE 
p577
V Oh. In about five, ten minutes.   (Jerry goes over to Elaine and George)  
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V So?  
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.    
p584
tp585
a(V ELAINE 
p586
V So when are we gonna eat?  
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V Five, ten minutes.  
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V We should have left earlier. I told you.   
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.   
p596
tp597
a(V ELAINE 
p598
V Oh, well I have to eat.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.   
p602
tp603
a(V ELAINE 
p604
V Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?   
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V We'll eat it in the movie.  
p608
tp609
a(V ELAINE 
p610
V Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big    picnic tables there?  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V Well what do you suggest?  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.   
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction,    let's just eat popcorn or something.  
p620
tp621
a(V BRUCE 
p622
V Cartwright?  
p623
tp624
a(V ELAINE 
p625
V I can't have popcorn for dinner!  
p626
tp627
a(V BRUCE 
p628
V Cartwright?  
p629
tp630
a(V ELAINE 
p631
V I have to eat!  
p632
tp633
a(V JERRY 
p634
V So they have hotdogs there.  
p635
tp636
a(V ELAINE 
p637
V Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.   
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me    just check.   (goes over to Bruce)  
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?    
p644
tp645
a(V BRUCE 
p646
V Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like    that. Nobody came up, I hang up.  
p647
tp648
a(V GEORGE 
p649
V Well, was it for Costanza or...  
p650
tp651
a(V BRUCE 
p652
V Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.    
p653
tp654
a(V GEORGE 
p655
V Well was it a woman?  
p656
tp657
a(V BRUCE 
p658
V Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.    (George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned)  
p659
tp660
a(V GEORGE 
p661
V She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.   
p662
tp663
a(V JERRY 
p664
V Who's Cartwright?  
p665
tp666
a(V GEORGE 
p667
V I'm Cartwright!  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V You're not Cartwri-  
p671
tp672
a(V GEORGE 
p673
V Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the    movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.    
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V So You're not going?  
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V You don't need us.  
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic    remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.    
p686
tp687
a(V GEORGE 
p688
V Should we tell him we're leaving?  
p689
tp690
a(V ELAINE 
p691
V What for? Let's just get out of here.     (they all leave)  
p692
