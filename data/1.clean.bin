aVthe stakeout written by larry david & jerry seinfeld so, i'm on line at the supermarket. two women in front of me. one of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. they both of course choose to pay by the use of the
p3
aa(lp4
Vaudience
p5
aVcheque
p6
aa(lp7
Vjerry
p8
aVcheque. now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you that's writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. i have noticed that women are very *fast* with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out so many cheques. the keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. they never fumble for book from an imaginary holster) ``who do i make it out to? there's my id ''. there's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. i don't know exactly what it is i think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says ``i don't have any money, but if you'll contact these people, i'm sure they'll stick up for me if you just trust me this one time i don't have any money but i have these i wrote on these is this of any value at all?''
