a(V JERRY 
p25
V I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.   
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V No everything is not going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have    no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. Once in     my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at    all. She has the hand; I have no hand...  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V How do I get the hand?  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the    hand right from the opening.  
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...    
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll    see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself.    Maybe I can get some hand that way.   Kramer enters

a(V JERRY 
p100
V Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you    think they have fleas there.  
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...   
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINELAINE 
p106
V I don't know how anyone does this. It must be so nerve racking...    How do they warm up their fingers?  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V They have a piano backstage they warm up on.   
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINELAINE 
p112
V No, we would have heard it.  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?   
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud    when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.  
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V (quickly whispering) I resent that you said that! That's    directed at me, isn't it?!   A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)

V Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He    just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.     I don't know what to do for the guy.

p155
tp156
a(V MOLLIKA 
p157
V What's that?  
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get    him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.  
p161
tp162
a(V MOLLIKA 
p163
V He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to    Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.     Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.   Outside Noel's dressing room

a(V ELAINELAINE 
p166
V I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!  
p167
tp168
a(V GEORGE 
p169
V What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first    place?  
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V I dunno, it was an impulse.  
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V What kind of a sick impulse does that??    
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V How could I know she would start to laugh?   
p179
tp180
a(V ELAINELAINE 
p181
V I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Can we just go in already?  
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V What are we gonna tell her?  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINELAINE 
p190
V I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.    
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then    I'm a jerk...  
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINELAINE

a(V GEORGE 
p235
V (Accusingly) What's that?  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!   
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V (Realizing full well it isn't) ...Yes it is.   
p242
tp243
a(V ELAINE 
p244
V Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from    Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told   him that he should do an intervention.  
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Really, an intervention ...  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V Y'know people, we got a situation over here!   
p251
tp252
a(V ELAINE

tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V Me? Why me?  
p257
tp258
a(V ELAINE 
p259
V 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V Y'know these things are really hard to load...   
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V All right, OK, I'm goin' in.  
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)    
p269
tp270
a(V ELAINE 
p271
V All right.   (They Enter)  
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.  
p275
tp276
a(V NOEL 
p277
V No..  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel   
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V You play a Hell of a piano.  
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.    
p287
tp288
a(V NOEL 
p289
V Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was    humiliated...  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you.  
p293
tp294
a(V NOEL 
p295
V Well then, what was she laughing at?    
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Pez?  
p299
tp300
a(V NOEL 
p301
V Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?    
p302
tp303
a(V GEORGE 
p304
V Me, uh, uh, no, ...  
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.   
p308
tp309
a(V ELAINE 
p310
V Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.   
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.   
p314
tp315
a(V NOEL 
p316
V I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. (exits)   
p317
tp318
a(V ELAINE 
p319
V I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.   
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)    (Noel enters)  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.   
p326
tp327
a(V NOEL 
p328
V I don't feel like it tonight.

a(V JERRY 
p331
V We'll be outside

p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.   
p359
tp360
a(V ELAINE 
p361
V What? How?  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.    Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.   
p365
tp366
a(V ELAINE 
p367
V So? What happened?  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,    and a month later he was dead.  
p371
tp372
a(V ELAINE 
p373
V Shut up!  
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.

tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V Whar about Kramer?  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382

p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for    an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye.    (to Kramer) Remember Ricie Appel?  
p386
tp387
a(V KRAMER 
p388
V (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?   
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.   
p392
tp393
a(V KRAMER 
p394
V Can I get in on that?  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V What do you think? It's like a poker game?   
p398
tp399
a(V KRAMER 
p400
V Is Elaine going?  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Yeah  
p404
tp405
a(V KRAMER 
p406
V Well, I knew him as well as she did.    
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Yeah, but John invited her.  
p410
tp411
a(V KRAMER 
p412
V So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?   
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.     Buzzer  
p416
tp417
a(V GEORGE 
p418
V It's George  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Stop smelling your arm.  
p422
tp423
a(V KRAMER 
p424
V You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just    came home from the beach  
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."   
p428
tp429
a(V KRAMER 
p430
V Tell me about it!  
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.    In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.     (George enters)  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Well it's over. It's definitely over.    
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V She broke up with you?  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation.    I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V What was on the list?  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,   
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,  
p452
tp453
a(V GEORGE 
p454
V Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said    "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.   
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V What's wrong with lunch?  
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.     I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.   
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?

tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V What?  
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.   
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V A preemptive breakup.  
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose.    We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some    Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.     (MONKS)   
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V So, I am have to going to break up with you.

p584
tp585
a(V STEVE 
p586
V Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead    fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come     home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.

a(V JERRY 
p772
V Hey Richie  
p773
tp774
a(V RICHIE 
p775
V So what's going on?   Later  
p776
tp777
a(V JERRY 
p778
V It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's     talking back.  
p779
tp780
a(V GEORGE 
p781
V I can't do these puzzles.  
p782
tp783
a(V JERRY

p785
tp786
a(V GEORGE 
p787
V Ah ah Pez dispenser.  
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's     telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and    his father was trying to load one of them  
p791
tp792
a(V GEORGE 
p793
V Well they're hard to load.  
p794
tp795
a(V JERRY 
p796
V Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control    of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all    over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.   
p797
tp798
a(V GEORGE 
p799
V Poor kid.  
p800
tp801
a(V JERRY 
p802
V So as he's telling the story he starts crying.   
p803
tp804
a(V GEORGE 
p805
V What did you do?  
p806
tp807
a(V JERRY 
p808
V What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.   
p809
tp810
a(V GEORGE 
p811
V Wow  
p812
tp813
a(V JERRY 
p814
V Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.     He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.   
p815
tp816
a(V GEORGE
