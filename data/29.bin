V  THE SUBWAY  Written by Larry Charles     (Monk's Cafe, the whole gang at a booth)   All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch    for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb    and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5,    but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith    and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.

a(V ELAINE

V Why not?  
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of    a salesman'.  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The    biggest loser in history of American literature.

tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they    flip a coin?  
p38
tp39
a(V ELAINE 
p40
V Yeah, they flip a coin.  
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.   
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)   
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're   
p50
tp51
a(V THINKING

a(V JERRY

p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V How many tickets are you paying today?    
p74
tp75

V No doors?

tp81
a(V KRAMER 
p82
V I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six    hundred bucks.   Blind violinist comes playing, with mug for the money. Everybody else gets    some change, except George.  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.    VIOLIN PLAYER  Thank you.

p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I    got to pick up my car at the pound. George?  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was    aligned.  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V That's amazing.  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on    me.

p106
V What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second    interview with them.

tp117
a(V KRAMER 
p118
V I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with    you?  
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to    rides alone.   SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT  42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.    They all get off and go to different directions.  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V See'ya.     Another subway. Jerry comes in and sits down. Fat man across him gives a    look.   George gets on another subway. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to    another.   Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles    around as all seats get filled right before him.   He squeezes himself to same seat with obese young man.   Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry    falls in his seat.     Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her.  
p125
tp126
a(V WOMAN 
p127
V You looking for a job?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V Me, why?  
p131
tp132
a(V WOMAN 
p133
V Well, you're reading the classifieds.    
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is.    Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM    up a quarter.  
p137
tp138
a(V WOMEN 
p139
V You didn't look like someone who needed a job.   
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.   
p143
tp144
a(V WOMEN 
p145
V So, you're in 'the market'?  
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.  
p149
tp150
a(V WOMEN 
p151
V Which market?  
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board.    Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.  
p155
tp156
a(V WOMEN 
p157
V So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?   
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion.    Big broker-houses killed my father.  
p161
tp162
a(V WOMAN 
p163
V Really?  
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long    story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would    never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm    about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've    never looked back.   Train horn blows and George looks back     Elaine's train. She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches    her  
p167
tp168
a(V WOMAN 
p169
V I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would    give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.   
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V It's ironic.  
p173
tp174
a(V WOMEN 
p175
V What's ironic?  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress,    but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.  
p179
tp180
a(V WOMAN 
p181
V No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?    
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V Oh...

p196
V Yeah  
p197
tp198
a(V WOMAN

V Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with    men and women.  
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V You're telling me.  
p203
tp204
a(V WOMAN 
p205
V So, are they a nice couple?  
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V Oh, very nice.  
p209
tp210
a(V WOMAN 
p211
V What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?   
p212
tp213
a(V ELAINE 
p214
V She.  
p215
tp216
a(V WOMEN 
p217
V She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.   
p218
tp219
a(V ELAINE 
p220
V There is no he.  
p221
tp222
a(V WOMEN 
p223
V There is no he. So, who's getting married?    
p224
tp225
a(V ELAINE 
p226
V Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.

tp228
a(V WOMEN 
p229
V Lesbian wedding.  
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.    
p233
tp234
a(V WOMEN 
p235
V My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the     subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)    
p236
tp237
a(V ELAINE 
p238
V No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men,    but I'm not a lesbian!     Kramer's train. A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat.     Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The    other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.      Jerry's train. He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor.    Man across gives him a look.     Elaine's train. Train is full packed.   ELAINE'S VOICE  I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe    I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.   Train suddenly stops   ELAINE'S VOICE  Oh, man. We're stopping?     George's train.  
p239
tp240
a(V WOMAN 
p241
V Well, this is where I get off.  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V Oh, you do?  
p245
tp246
a(V WOMAN 
p247
V Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.    
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V No, no, what, what?  
p251
tp252
a(V WOMAN 
p253
V Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're    obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.   
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Yeah, well....  
p257
tp258
a(V WOMAN 
p259
V Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.   George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her   
p260
tp261
a(V GEORGE 
p262
V Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when    I wanna get off.   He gets stuck between closing doors.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train!    Don't start the train!!     Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking.     MAN1  This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.    MAN2  How do you know it's going to win?     MAN1  My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers.    Every horse he has ever given me has won.   See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been    getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't    been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his     a lock.   MAN2  But it rained last night.   MAN1  Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His    father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.   MAN2  His mudda' was a mudda'?   MAN1  What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to    call my bookie. Hey, don't tell anybody.   Kramer quickly turns away     Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy is naked and    reading a paper.  
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?     NAKED MAN  Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.    
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.     NAKED MAN  You got something against naked body?    
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends,    maybe a squat thrust?   NAKED MAN  Who's got time for squat thrusts?  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a    'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.   NAKED MAN  I like a good breakfast.  
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up    trapped in a room with bimbo broals(?) and pigtails, been counseled by Dick    Gregory.   NAKED MAN  I'm not ashamed of my body.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY

tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V Don't get up, please, allow me.   Jerry picks up the paper     Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.   ELAINE'S VOICE  Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need.    Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're    stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people?    This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is    so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel    something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in    a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring.    What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't    breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about    the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And    hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This    is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help    me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What    can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a    train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the    conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be    moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!    Lights in the train go off     George and the woman step in to a hotel room.

p290
tp291
a(V WOMAN 
p292
V Make your-self comfortable.   She steps in to bathroom.   GEORGE'S VOICE  Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want    me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my    clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot.    She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what    then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself    comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing     can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There,    that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.     She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie.  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.       Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. He is talking with a guy    behind in the line.

V It's a deal!     Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights.   ELAINE'S VOICE  Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life    could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What    if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1    banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still    here!

p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in    her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really    disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version    of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing,     cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse    looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.

V Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)     Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around.    There is a big thug looking at the money.   Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes    a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the    thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes.       The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of    the train.    I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.
