V  THE NOTE  Written by Larry David     Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best.   There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him.   He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."      (Jerry is getting a massage.)   ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat   whatever I want.

a(V JERRY 
p4
V What do you think the worst part of being blind is?   
p5
tp6
a(V JULIANNA 
p7
V Excuse me?  
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would    be?  
p11
tp12
a(V JULIANNA 
p13
V I don't know.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.    How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around   with my lips and my tongue.  
p17
tp18
a(V JULIANNA 
p19
V Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.   
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in   Pennsylvania?  
p23
tp24
a(V JULIANNA 
p25
V No.  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next   thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.  
p29
tp30
a(V JULIANNA 
p31
V Oh.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. And   these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one   of these people.  
p35
tp36
a(V JULIANNA 
p37
V Have you seen any good movies?  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V Who takes care of your boy during the day?   
p41
tp42
a(V JULIANNA 
p43
V We have a woman. Why?  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V No no. I'm just saying.  
p47
tp48
a(V JULIANNA 
p49
V She had references.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the   ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.    
p53
tp54
a(V JULIANNA 
p55
V I don't live near here, ya know!      Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment.  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.   
p59
tp60
a(V ELAINE 
p61
V I don't like to talk during a massage.    
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.   
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel   like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's   nothing to eat in here.  
p68
tp69
a(V ELAINE 
p70
V Oh! I forgot to tell you--  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V I'm in the middle of a story.  
p74
tp75
a(V ELAINE 
p76
V Okay, go ahead.  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V Why don't you ever go shopping?  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Not like it's a really funny story or anything.   
p83
tp84
a(V ELAINE 
p85
V What happened?  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and the for some reason I   launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.   
p89
tp90
a(V ELAINE 
p91
V Oh, wasn't that terrible?  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Yes, it was.  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V Not even an apple.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.   
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V I know it was stupid.  
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE 
p106
V Really stupid.  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V Hey, I just said it was stupid.  
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V What about this leftover Chinese food?    
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Take it.  
p116
tp117
a(V ELAINE 
p118
V I can't believe you said that.  
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Hey, would you stop it already?  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V So, what did she say?  
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't   understand how anyone can eat ginger.  
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V I have a good masseuse you could go to.   
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical    therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real   medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by   insurance.  
p137
tp138
a(V GEORGE 
p139
V Physical therapy is covered by insurance?    
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Yeah.  
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V You don't have to pay for the massage?    
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Not if you have a doctor's note.  
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V So where do you get this note?  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could   probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.  
p155
tp156
a(V GEORGE 
p157
V Right, your friend Roy.  
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V What's the name of this physical therapist?    
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little   off.  
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V And you don't have to pay.     George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.  
p167
tp168
a(V GEORGE 
p169
V We have three-o'clock appointments.    
p170
tp171
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p172
V George and Elaine, right? Could you fill these out for me   please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll be with   Raymond.  
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?  
p176
tp177
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p178
V Yes.  
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V But, uh, Raymond is a man.  
p182
tp183
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p184
V That's right.   George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.  
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V I can't get a massage from a man.  
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V Why not?  
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.   
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINE 
p196
V No, I don't want the man either.  
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching   you.  
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V He'd just be touching your back.  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V He'd just be touching your back too.    
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V No, it could get sexual.  
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get   sexual with you.  
p212
tp213
a(V ELAINE 
p214
V I wouldn't be comfortable.  
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V I would? What if something happens?    
p218
tp219
a(V ELAINE 
p220
V What could happen?  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V What if it felt good?  
p224
tp225
a(V ELAINE 
p226
V It's supposed to feel good.  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V I don't want it to feel good.  
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Then why get the massage?  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Exactly!   A man walks up dressed in white.  
p236
tp237
a(V RAYMOND 
p238
V George?  
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V Yes?  
p242
tp243
a(V RAYMOND 
p244
V I'm Raymond.  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V Hello.  
p248
tp249
a(V RAYMOND 
p250
V Are you ready?   George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.     George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George appears extremely   uncomfortable.  
p251
tp252
a(V RAYMOND 
p253
V ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the   office.  
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Really.  
p257
tp258
a(V RAYMOND 
p259
V I used to be a flight attendant.  
p260
tp261
a(V GEORGE 
p262
V Oh boy.  
p263
tp264
a(V RAYMOND 
p265
V Ya know, why don't you open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier   that way.   George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down his hips then   starts massaging his lower back.  
p266
tp267
a(V RAYMOND 
p268
V So what do you do?  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V What?  
p272
tp273
a(V RAYMOND 
p274
V I said, 'What do you do?'.  
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V I don't know.  
p278
tp279
a(V RAYMOND 
p280
V You don't know what you do?  
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V Nah.  
p284
tp285
a(V RAYMOND 
p286
V Oh, come on. Hey, you're very tense.    
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V Coffee. Too much coffee.  
p290
tp291
a(V RAYMOND 
p292
V Okay, just take off those pants now, I'll work the hamstring.   
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V Oh, the hamstring's fine.  
p296
tp297
a(V RAYMOND 
p298
V But you wrote that it was tender.  
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.  
p302
tp303
a(V RAYMOND 
p304
V I'll check it out.  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V Are you sure?  
p308
tp309
a(V RAYMOND 
p310
V Yeah, take 'em off.   George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his   hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs back on the   table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with   discomfort.  
p311
tp312
a(V RAYMOND 
p313
V How did you hurt this?  
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V I don't know.  
p317
tp318
a(V RAYMOND 
p319
V You don't know?  
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V No.  
p323
tp324
a(V RAYMOND 
p325
V But you just told me--  
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V Korea.  
p329
tp330
a(V RAYMOND 
p331
V You hurt it in Korea?  
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V What?  
p335
tp336
a(V RAYMOND 
p337
V The hamstring.  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V Korea.  
p341
tp342
a(V RAYMOND 
p343
V How?  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V Hamstring.  
p347
tp348
a(V RAYMOND 
p349
V How did you hurt the hamstring?  
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V Hotel.     Elaine is in the waiting room, George walks out very slowly, he appears   positively shell-shocked.  
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V How'd it go? George?   George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.     Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about   Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.   George enters acting nervous.  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V What's with you?  
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V A...   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Yes, A...?  
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V A man gave me...  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Yes, a man gave you...?  
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V A man gave me... a massage.  
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V So?  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...    
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V He was what?!  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V He was... touching and rubbing.  
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V That's a massage.  
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V And then I took my pants off.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V You took your pants off?  
p398
tp399
a(V GEORGE 
p400
V For my hamstring.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Oh.  
p404
tp405
a(V GEORGE 
p406
V He got about two inches from... there.    
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Really?  
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V I think it moved.  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V Moved?  
p416
tp417
a(V GEORGE 
p418
V It may have moved, I don't know.  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V I'm sure it didn't move.  
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V It moved! It was imperceptible but I felt it.   
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other   side.  
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.   
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V Okay, so what if it moved?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V That's the sign! The test; if a man makes it move.   
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of   contact.  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V You think it's contact? It has to be touched?   
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V That's what a gym teacher once told me.    Kramer enters.  
p446
tp447
a(V KRAMER 
p448
V Hey.  
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V Hey.  
p452
tp453
a(V KRAMER 
p454
V I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I looked in there   and there he was having coffee and a donut.  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?  
p458
tp459
a(V KRAMER 
p460
V Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant   or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.  
p464
tp465
a(V KRAMER 
p466
V Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees   might touch.  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy    smelly Dinky Donuts.  
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?   
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.    
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V I don't even like to use urinals, I've always been a stall man.   
p482
tp483
a(V KRAMER 
p484
V Look I'm telling-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm   telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio.  
p485
tp486
a(V GEORGE 
p487
V The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about   this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.  
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V I never said I'd do that.  
p491
tp492
a(V GEORGE 
p493
V What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not   working, I can't afford that.  
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V I don't know how I feel about it.  
p497
tp498
a(V GEORGE 
p499
V Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?    
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V Alright, alright.  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V A stall man, huh?     George and Jerry are in Roy's office.  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write   us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.  
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V He didn't say he can't.  
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V I mean, if you feel funny about it at all.   
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V He doesn't feel funny.  
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V If he does.  
p521
tp522
a(V GEORGE 
p523
V Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.    
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V He feels funny. You don't have to do this.   
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V He knows that!  
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?   
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V Oh, can you be any more dramatic?  
p536
tp537
a(V ROY 
p538
V Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall)    Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a   body, doesn't he?  
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V How would I know?  
p542
tp543
a(V ROY 
p544
V Do you like him?  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V What do you mean, like him?

a(V ROY 
p550
V Do you like him?  
p551
tp552
a(V GEORGE 
p553
V I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.   
p554
tp555
a(V ROY 
p556
V How come you don't like him?  
p557
tp558
a(V GEORGE 
p559
V Why should I?  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V What is the matter with you?  
p563
tp564
a(V GEORGE 
p565
V Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?   
p566
tp567
a(V ROY 
p568
V So, you want the notes?  
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V You don't have to, really.  
p572
tp573
a(V ROY 
p574
V Nah nah, it's ok.  
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to   George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?       Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.    
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V Well what about the week after? No appointments at all? (Jerry tries   to sit down on the couch, but Elaine is too close to the end and he has to   squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down) Can I at least just talk to her   so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one   innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman   is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?  
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V What?  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.   
p587
tp588
a(V ELAINE 
p589
V Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.    Kramer enters.  
p590
tp591
a(V KRAMER 
p592
V Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.   
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V Uh huh.  
p596
tp597
a(V ELAINE 
p598
V Joe DiMaggio?  
p599
tp600
a(V KRAMER 
p601
V Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him   and I really watched him. I studied his every move. For example, he dunks.   
p602
tp603
a(V ELAINE 
p604
V Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?  
p605
tp606
a(V KRAMER 
p607
V That's right.  
p608
tp609
a(V JERRY 
p610
V See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.   
p611
tp612
a(V KRAMER 
p613
V Oh, he's a dunker.  
p614
tp615
a(V ELAINE 
p616
V Why couldn't he be a dunker?  
p617
tp618
a(V KRAMER 
p619
V And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, like I'm   sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, you know, to uh,   look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the   table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping   noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because   the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on   around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.   
p620
tp621
a(V ELAINE 
p622
V So then what?  
p623
tp624
a(V KRAMER 
p625
V Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or   they're gonna throw me out.  
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V Why didn't you just call out his name?     George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee.  
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V What happened to you?  
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V One of those kids called me a Mary.    
p635
tp636
a(V ELAINE 
p637
V A what?  
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this.   (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) They called me a Mary. So I   chased them, and I tripped and I fell.  
p641
tp642
a(V KRAMER 
p643
V Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.   
p644
tp645
a(V ELAINE 
p646
V Hey, George? What is this? (Elaine makes the same outstretched arm   motion) What is that? No really, what is that?   George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs   it from him.  
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god, how did this happen? What can I   do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under   investigation for insurance fraud.  
p650
tp651
a(V KRAMER 
p652
V ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe,   Joe. Go, Joe...  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V I told you.  
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V Told me what?  
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V I told you we shouldn't do it.  
p662
tp663
a(V GEORGE 
p664
V He didn't say anything.  
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You   should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have   got three notes.  
p668
tp669
a(V ELAINE 
p670
V Three notes?  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V Yeah, you, me and George.  
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V You got me a note?  
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V Yeah.  
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V But I got my own note.  
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V You what?  
p686
tp687
a(V ELAINE 
p688
V I got a note from my gynecologist.    
p689
tp690
a(V JERRY 
p691
V Why'd you do that?  
p692
tp693
a(V ELAINE 
p694
V I didn't know you were getting me a note.   
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V Of course I was getting you a note.    
p698
tp699
a(V ELAINE 
p700
V But you didn't say anything.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from   two doctors.  
p704
tp705
a(V KRAMER 
p706
V How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot   of other stuff. Oh, yeah.   Kramer leaves.     Jerry and George are at Roy's office.  
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V Hi Pam.  
p710

p713
tp714
a(V GEORGE 
p715
V Hello.  
p716
tp717
a(V JERRY 
p718
V I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy.    Roy walks in.  
p719
tp720
a(V ROY 
p721
V Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.   
p722
tp723
a(V JERRY 
p724
V Hi Roy.  
p725
tp726
a(V GEORGE 
p727
V How ya doing?  
p728
tp729
a(V ROY 
p730
V Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.      Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a dental chair.   
p731
tp732
a(V JERRY 
p733
V I don't even know what to say.  
p734
tp735
a(V GEORGE 
p736
V Me neither.  
p737
tp738
a(V JERRY 
p739
V I knew this would happen.  
p740
tp741
a(V GEORGE 
p742
V Me too.  
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V I mean the whole thing, it's just...    
p746
tp747
a(V GEORGE 
p748
V Tragic.  
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V Well it's not tragic.  
p752
tp753
a(V GEORGE 
p754
V No?  
p755
tp756
a(V JERRY 
p757
V No, it's...  
p758
tp759
a(V GEORGE 
p760
V Unsettling?  
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V Okay. I mean, what if the--   Pam walks in and interrupts.  
p764
tp765
a(V PAM 
p766
V I hope you're both happy.  
p767
tp768
a(V JERRY 
p769
V I'm not happy.  
p770
tp771
a(V GEORGE 
p772
V Me neither. I've never been happy.    
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not now.   
p776
tp777
a(V GEORGE 
p778
V In college, maybe. Those were fun times.    
p779
tp780
a(V JERRY 
p781
V Yeah, college was fun.   Pam walks in again and interjects.  
p782
tp783
a(V PAM 
p784
V You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that?   
p785
tp786
a(V ROY 
p787
V Don't mind her.  
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V Oh please, I love her.  
p791
tp792
a(V GEORGE 
p793
V I've just met her but I'm very impressed.    
p794
tp795
a(V ROY 
p796
V I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.   
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V What's the next move, what's gonna happen now?   
p800
tp801
a(V ROY 
p802
V Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along    with our story.  
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V What? The physical therapist? Why?    
p806
tp807
a(V ROY 
p808
V She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.    The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.    
p809
tp810
a(V GEORGE 
p811
V How ya doing?     Jerry and George are at Julianna's office.  
p812
tp813
a(V JERRY 
p814
V Hi. Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important   that I talk with Julianna.  
p815
tp816
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p817
V I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not it.    
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really have to speak with her.   
p821
tp822
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p823
V I told you, she's not here.  
p824
tp825
a(V JERRY 
p826
V You don't understand.  
p827
tp828
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p829
V Look, you have to leave.  
p830
tp831
a(V JERRY 
p832
V Wait a second, don't you-- (Julianna walks up with her child) Hi. Hi.    Look, I don't know what you--  
p833
tp834
a(V JULIANNA 
p835
V Please!  
p836
tp837
a(V JERRY 
p838
V --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is    inadvertently sent an insurance--  
p839
tp840
a(V JULIANNA 
p841
V I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!   
p842
tp843
a(V JERRY 
p844
V Can't you just listen to me?  
p845
tp846
a(V JULIANNA 
p847
V Run Billy! Run to the office and close the   door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!   Julianna then runs down the hall.  
p848
tp849
a(V JERRY 
p850
V The police?   Raymond the masseuse walks up.  
p851
tp852
a(V RAYMOND 
p853
V Hi George.  
p854
tp855
a(V GEORGE 
p856
V Hello.  
p857
tp858
a(V JERRY 
p859
V Raymond?     Elaine, Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.  
p860
tp861
a(V ELAINE 
p862
V Well, I mean it's only six months probation, it's a slap on the wrist.   
p863
tp864
a(V JERRY 
p865
V Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.   
p866
tp867
a(V GEORGE 
p868
V Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll   be in the middle.  
p869
tp870
a(V ELAINE 
p871
V Of what? Oh.  
p872
tp873
a(V GEORGE 
p874
V And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here!   What do you want? You don't belong here!"  
p875
tp876
a(V ELAINE 
p877
V What do they do?  
p878
tp879
a(V GEORGE 
p880
V They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get   the hell out of here!"   Jerry spots Kramer through the window.  
p881
tp882
a(V JERRY 
p883
V Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention)    Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.   Kramer enters and sits at the booth.  
p884
tp885
a(V KRAMER 
p886
V I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.    The three all put down their coffee cups simultaneously.  
p887
tp888
a(V JERRY 
p889
V Did he say anything?  
p890
tp891
a(V KRAMER 
p892
V No no, he's fine.  
p893
tp894
a(V JERRY 
p895
V Oh my god, it's...  
p896
tp897
a(V GEORGE 
p898
V Joe DiMaggio.  
p899
tp900
a(V KRAMER 
p901
V Where?  
p902
tp903

V Having a cup of coffee.  
p905
tp906
a(V ELAINE 
p907
V He's dunking!  
p908
tp909
a(V JERRY 
p910
V Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. Here.   
p911
tp912
a(V GEORGE 
p913
V You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at   George) Oh please.
