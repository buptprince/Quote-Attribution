aVthe stock tip written by larry david & jerry seinfeld went out to dinner the other night. check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money's a very different thing before and after you eat. before you eat money has no value. and you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a restaurant. you're like the ruler of an empire. more drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! it will be the greatest meal of our lives. then after the meal, you know, you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. people are always upset, you know. they're mystified by the check. what is this? how could this be? they start passing it around the table, does this look right to you? we're not hungry now. why are we buying all this food?! i think superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
p3
aa(lp4
Vgeorge
p5
aVi never heard him say anything really funny.
p6
aa(lp7
Vjerry
p8
aVbut it's common sense. he's got super strength, super speed i'm sure he's got super humor.
p9
aa(lp10
Vgeorge
p11
aVyou would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. it's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the earth.
p12
aa(lp13
Vjerry
p14
aVwhy? why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of earth?
p15
aa(lp16
Vgeorge
p17
aVi don't know but he ain't funny.
p18
aa(lp19
Velaine
p20
aVi know, i know. i'm sorry i'm late.
p21
aa(lp22
Vjerry
p23
aVno problem.

aa(lp28
Vgeorge

aVpardon?
p30
aa(lp31
Velaine
p32
aVi dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. i couldn't find it. i was i was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. i have no idea where it went.
p33
aa(lp34
Vjerry
p35
aVwere you crying? i mean, it's just a grape. you'll find it.
p36
aa(lp37
Velaine
p38
aVno, i'm just getting over an allergy attack. this guy i'm going out with -
p39
aa(lp40
Vjerry
p41
aVrobert.
p42
aa(lp43
Velaine
p44
aVrobert. yes thank you. he has two cats and i'm allergic to them. you know, i finally meet a normal man, and i can't even go into his apartment, you know. and, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. it's really causing a lot of problems, you know. he won't even go away fro the weekend because of these cats.
p45
aa(lp46
Vgeorge
p47
aVguys with cats i don't know.
p48
aa(lp49
Vjerry

aa(lp52
Velaine
p53
aVvanessa.
p54
aa(lp55
Vjerry
p56
aVvanessa, thank you i've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
p57
aa(lp58
Vgeorge
p59
aVoh no. no, no,no,no,no. i'd have to advise against that. what do you know this woman, a month? let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two hours. that's a dating decathlon.
p60
aa(lp61
Velaine
p62
aVhey, why don't you take her to that place in vermont i was telling you about? you know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. she'll love it.
p63
aa(lp64
Vgeorge
p65
aVthat's exquisite. listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
p66
aa(lp67
Vjerry
p68
aVyou better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. there was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the texas panhandle. they brought in the army, nobody could stop it. apparently it had a pit of steel.
p69
aa(lp70
Vgeorge

p195
aa(lp196
Vjerry
p197
aVit's great! it speeds up the intimacy level. it's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days.

Vvanessa

aVoh, so you want to move our relationship into phase two ?
p201
aa(lp202
Vjerry
p203

aa(lp322
Vgeorge

aa(lp328

aVto the hospital.
p336
aa(lp337
Vjerry
p338
aVthe hospital?
p339
aa(lp340
Vgeorge
p341
aVi'm going to find out what's going on. alright?
p342
aa(lp343
Vjerry
p344
aVare you nuts? you don't even know they guy.
p345
aa(lp346
Vgeorge
p347
aVso what? i'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and i'll work my way around to it.
p348
aa(lp349
Vjerry
p350
aVwhat if he's in an iron lung or something? what are you gonna do? how you feeling, mr. wilkinson? by the way, what's happening with sendrax?
p351
aa(lp352
Vgeorge
p353
aVmaybe he's resting.
p354
aa(lp355
Vjerry
p356
aVwho goes to the hospital to rest?
p357
aa(lp358
Vgeorge
p359
aVwhat are you, a doctor?
p360
aa(lp361
Vjerry
p362
aVokay, fine, fine. when are you going down there?
p363
aa(lp364
Vgeorge
p365
aVtoday. i'm going today. just don't do anything until you hear from me.
p366
aa(lp367
Vjerry
p368
aValright.
p369
aa(lp370
Vgeorge
p371
aVboy, i have to get to a bathroom. dry cleaner may i help you?
p372
aa(lp373
Vjerry
p374
aVyeah. i picked up this shirt here yesterday. it's completely shrunk. there's absolutely no way i can wear it. dry cleaner when did you bring it in?
p375
aa(lp376
Vjerry
p377
aVwhat's the difference? look at it! do you see the size of this shirt?! dry cleaner you got a receipt?
p378
aa(lp379
Vjerry
p380
aVi can't find the receipt. dry cleaner you should get the receipt.
p381
aa(lp382
Vjerry
p383
aVlook, forget about the receipt, all right? even if i had the receipt- look at it! it's a hand puppet. what am i gonna do with this?! dry cleaner yes, but how do i know we did the shirt?
p384
aa(lp385
Vjerry
p386
aVwhat do you think this is a little scam i have? i take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! in fact, forget the money. i don't even want the money. i just once, i would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. that's what i want. i want an admission of guilt. dry cleaner maybe you asked for it to be washed?
p387
aa(lp388
Vjerry
p389
aVno dry-cleaned. dry cleaner let me explain to you something. okay? with certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing
p390
aa(lp391
Vjerry
p392
aVyou shrunk it! you know you shrunk it! just tell me that you shrunk it! dry cleaner i shrunk it.
p393
aa(lp394
Vjerry
p395
aVi think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner, well, it's ruined. and of course, the dry cleaner can respond, it's not our fault. we're not responsible. we just ruin the clothes. that ends our legal obligation. you see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. right? they're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. it's all dry. i know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they're using. there's no such thing as dry cleaning. when you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that - that's dry cleaning. i don't think that's what they're doing back there. they don't have eighty guys going come on, hurry up! there's a lot of shirts today.
p396
aa(lp397
Vjerry
p398
aVbless you.
p399
aa(lp400
Velaine
p401
aVthank you. what evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? huh? what do they do? because they're clean? i am sorry. my uncle pete showers four times a day and he can't count to ten. so don't give me hygiene.
p402
aa(lp403
Vjerry
p404
aVso what are you gonna do?
p405
aa(lp406
Velaine
p407
aVi don't know. i can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. what do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
p408
aa(lp409
Vjerry
p410
aVwell, it couldn't be too expensive. thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
p411
aa(lp412
Velaine
p413
aVwhat do you think, jerry? you wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
p414
aa(lp415
Vjerry
p416
aVi'm no cat killer.
p417
aa(lp418
Velaine
p419
aVhow about we go over there right now and we shave them?
p420
aa(lp421
Vjerry
p422
aVi'd really like to go, elaine. but, george is coming back from the hospital. i gotta wait for him. but otherwise i would definitely go.
