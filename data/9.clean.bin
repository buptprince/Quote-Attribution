aVthe apartment written by peter mehlman well, i painted my apartment again. i've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time i paint it, it kinda gets me down. i look around, and i think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. you know, i realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but i'm aware of it. it keeps coming in and coming in. everytime i paint it, it's closer and closer. i don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. i just look for like a lump with two slots in it. kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. that's where i plug in my idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the starship enterprise. you know what i mean? big chair, nice screen, remote control that's why star trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. just hurling through space in your living room, watching tv. that's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because kirk was the only one that had a big screen. they came over friday night, klingon boxing gotta be there.

aVthe problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. i think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie. you mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. you know what i mean? think of the things you wish you could take back. you're out somewhere with people, gee, you look pregnant are ya? cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. walk out the door, and come back in. let's take this whole scene again. people, think about what you're saying!

p258
aa(lp259
Vgeorge
p260
aVhow could you do that?
p261
aa(lp262
Vjerry
p263
aV'cause i'm an idiot! you may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - i'm a much bigger idiot than you are.
p264
aa(lp265
Vgeorge
p266
aVdon't insult me, my friend. remember who you're talking to. no one's a bigger idiot than me.
p267
aa(lp268
Vjerry
p269
aVdid you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
p270
aa(lp271
Vgeorge
p272
aVdid you ever go to a singles weekend in the poconos?
p273
aa(lp274
Vjerry
p275
aVshe's right in my building! right above me! every time i come in the building, i'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
p276
aa(lp277
Vgeorge
p278
aVyou're doomed. you're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. it'll be like a permanent road trip. forget about the home bed advantage.

p300
aa(lp301
Vjerry
p302
aVmy censoring system broke down. you know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? makes sure you don't make a mistake? he went for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.
p303
aa(lp304
Vgeorge
p305
aVmy censor quit two years ago. he checked into a clinic. emotionally exhausted.
p306
aa(lp307
Vjerry
p308
aVso, is there any way out of this elaine thing?
p309
aa(lp310
Vgeorge
p311
aVtough.
p312
aa(lp313
Vjerry
p314
aVyou know, the water pressure's terrible in my building and she loves a good shower.
p315
aa(lp316
Vgeorge
p317
aVi don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
p318
aa(lp319
Vjerry
p320
aVif they were fanatic about showers, they might.
p321
aa(lp322
Vgeorge
p323
aVfor that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to
p324
aa(lp325
Vjerry
p326
aVlook at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. isn't that child abuse?
p327
aa(lp328
Vgeorge
p329
aVi'd like to have a kid. of course, you have to have a date first remember my friend, adam, from detroit?
p330
aa(lp331
Vjerry
p332
aVyeah, the guy with the flat head?
p333
aa(lp334
Vgeorge
p335
aVhe's a cube anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
p336
aa(lp337
Vjerry
p338
aVyeah, i've heard that about wedding bands.
p339
aa(lp340
Vgeorge
p341
aVi wonder if that's really true.
p342
aa(lp343
Vjerry
p344
aVthat would be an interesting sociological experiment. you know, kramer has his father's band. he'd loan it to you.
p345
aa(lp346
Vgeorge
p347
aVthanks a lot. i ll give it back to you in a week.
p348
aa(lp349
Vkramer
p350
aVyou know, i don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. i've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.
p351
aa(lp352
Vgeorge
p353
aVi'm not doing that.
p354
aa(lp355
Vkramer
p356
aVoh, man. you know, you're crazy. you're a good looking guy. what do you want to walk around like that for?
p357
aa(lp358
Vgeorge

p360
aa(lp361
Vharold
p362
aVi told you i don't like these sponges, they're too small! i want a big sponge! you can't pick up anything with these! there's no absorption!

aVbecause somebody offered manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. i don't want to do it. manny wants to do it. because it's true! why shouldn't i tell him?
p381
aa(lp382
Vjerry
p383
aVhey, hey. i understand. you're businessmen.
p384
aa(lp385
Vharold
p386
aVoh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.
p387
aa(lp388
Vjerry
p389
aVwell, that's a lot of money. but, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. you know, i used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
p390
aa(lp391
Vgeorge
p392
aVwhat happened to you?
p393
aa(lp394
Vjerry
p395
aVreligion, my friend, that's what happened to me. because, i have just been informed that it's going to cost elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
p396
aa(lp397
Vgeorge
p398
aVfive thousand dollars? she doesn't have five thousand dollars!
p399
aa(lp400
Vjerry
p401
aVof course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!

p426
aa(lp427
Vgeorge

aa(lp445
Vjerry
