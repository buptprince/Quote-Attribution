V  THE PARKING SPACE  Written by Larry David & Greg Daniels     (Comedy club)   At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that   discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of   the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there   with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody   goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in   there."   Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.   Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen   again.

a(V JERRY

V What are you talking about?  
p5
tp6
a(V KRAMER 
p7
V Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?   
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V Yeah.  
p11
tp12
a(V KRAMER 
p13
V Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.   
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Oh yeah, I know.  
p17
tp18
a(V KRAMER 
p19
V Well, where is it?  
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V What's the difference?  
p23
tp24
a(V KRAMER 
p25
V Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.   
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?   
p29
tp30
a(V KRAMER 
p31
V What happened to the car?  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?   
p35
tp36
a(V KRAMER 
p37
V Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V You have to know, you must know.  
p41
tp42
a(V KRAMER 
p43
V I must know.  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V Well, I'm not telling you.  
p47
tp48
a(V KRAMER 
p49
V Oh, come on.  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V Nope. I don't think so.  
p53
tp54
a(V KRAMER 
p55
V Well, please?  
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V Not today, pal.  
p59
tp60
a(V KRAMER 
p61
V Okay, I beg you.  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put   some beg into it.  
p65
tp66
a(V KRAMER 
p67
V Okay, please! Please tell me!  
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.   
p71
tp72
a(V KRAMER 
p73
V Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.  
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V I loaned the car to George.  
p77
tp78
a(V KRAMER 
p79
V Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?    
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!   
p83
tp84
a(V KRAMER 
p85
V Alright.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V Huh?  
p89
tp90
a(V KRAMER 
p91
V Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?   
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Will you stop it already?!  
p95
tp96
a(V KRAMER 
p97
V You know, why didn't they ask me to go?   
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!    
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V What, they don't like me?  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V *I* don't like you!  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.      George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.   
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V I really think it looks good.  
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?  
p116
tp117
a(V GEORGE 
p118
V All bald people look good in hats.    
p119
tp120
a(V ELAINE 
p121
V You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore   hats all the time then.  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.   
p125
tp126
a(V ELAINE 
p127
V Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that   first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her   face.  
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V Are you sure you like these sunglasses?     Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this   causes George to swerve and hit something.    Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.  
p134
tp135
a(V KRAMER 
p136
V Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm   somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Why not?  
p140
tp141
a(V KRAMER 
p142
V Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got   problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?   
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.    Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.  
p146
tp147
a(V KRAMER 
p148
V Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?   
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V No, I like Mike.  
p152
tp153
a(V KRAMER 
p154
V Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great   conversation.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Oh yeah? What did you talk about?  
p158
tp159
a(V KRAMER 
p160
V Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty   interesting things to say.  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Oh yeah? What did he say?  
p164
tp165
a(V KRAMER 
p166
V You have to know everything, don't you?    
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?    
p170
tp171
a(V KRAMER 
p172
V Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?   
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.    
p176
tp177
a(V KRAMER 
p178
V Beg me.  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Please, don't make me beg.  
p182
tp183
a(V KRAMER 
p184
V No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just    want you to put some beg into it. Go on.  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.   
p188
tp189
a(V KRAMER 
p190
V No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No,   it's close, but uh...  
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Kramer!  
p194
tp195
a(V KRAMER 
p196
V Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in   confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.  
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.   
p200
tp201
a(V KRAMER 
p202
V Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the   vault, it's a vault!  
p206
tp207
a(V KRAMER 
p208
V He thinks you're a phony.  
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V He what?  
p212
tp213
a(V KRAMER 
p214
V I told you, he thinks you're a phony.    
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V A phony? He called me a phony?  
p218
tp219
a(V KRAMER 
p220
V A big phone. A big one.  
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!   
p224
tp225
a(V KRAMER 
p226
V You begged me.    Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking   noise.  
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Do you hear that?  
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Of course I hear that.  
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V You had to move the mirror?  
p236
tp237
a(V ELAINE 
p238
V I wanted to check out my sunglasses.    
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my   equilibrium.  
p242
tp243
a(V ELAINE 
p244
V Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.   
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V I can't drive?  
p248
tp249
a(V ELAINE 
p250
V Yeah.  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have   no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane?   Watch this.  
p254
tp255
a(V ELAINE 
p256
V No, I really don't.  
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.   
p260
tp261
a(V ELAINE 
p262
V I'm sure you could.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?   
p266
tp267
a(V ELAINE 
p268
V I don't know.  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Alright, start looking for spaces.    
p272
tp273
a(V ELAINE 
p274
V Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a    garage.  
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front    of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.    
p278
tp279
a(V ELAINE 
p280
V Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend   an hour looking for a space.  
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V I can't park in a garage.  
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Why?  
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking,   it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother,   nobody. We can't do it.  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V I'll pay for it.  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's   like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I   could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go   around me, I'm looking for spaces.  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V Oh George, there's a space right there!    
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream    space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did   I tell you?  
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.    They share a laugh.  
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into   his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living   parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all   the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in,   that's the key.  
p308
tp309
a(V ELAINE 
p310
V Will you just park it already?  
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's   so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this   guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!   
p314
tp315
a(V ELAINE 
p316
V George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking    space in this city.  
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V No no no, he's not getting away with this.   
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V George?   George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Hey, what are you doing?  
p326
tp327
a(V MIKE 
p328
V I think I'm parking my car.  
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.   
p332
tp333
a(V MIKE 
p334
V I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just   sitting there three spaces up.  
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head   first?  
p338
tp339
a(V MIKE 
p340
V Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I    pulled in.  
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V I was in the middle of a conversation.    
p344
tp345
a(V MIKE 
p346
V Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?  
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V The point is I was here first.  
p350
tp351
a(V MIKE 
p352
V I was closer to this space than you were.   
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!   
p356
tp357
a(V MIKE 
p358
V I can if I have room!  
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V Are you gonna move the car?  
p362
tp363
a(V MIKE 
p364
V No, I'm not gonna move the car.  
p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V Jerk!  
p368
tp369
a(V MIKE 
p370
V Oh, you're not?  
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V Do you believe this guy?  
p374
tp375
a(V ELAINE 
p376
V Come on, we'll put it in a garage.    
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.   
p380
tp381
a(V ELAINE 
p382
V What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh.   I'm going upstairs.  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Are you coming back down?  
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.   
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what    are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?    
p392
tp393
a(V ELAINE 
p394
V Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.   
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V Oh, come on, you're good at this.  
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V What am I gonna say?  
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.    Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.     Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.   
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?   
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Yeah, under the counter. What happened?    
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the   way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a   bag of chips off the counter)  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V Tell me what happened.   Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and   the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of   extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some   reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the   toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?!   So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a   souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the   car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a   great driver.  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V He is?  
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.   
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V A gun?!  
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the   city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.   
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V My god, are you okay?  
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now    it's making a clanking noise.  
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.    
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V Exactly.  
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V Where's George now?  
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy   about a parking space.  
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V What are you talking about?  
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Look out the window, you'll see.  
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V Hey Georgie!  
p455
tp456
a(V GEORGE 
p457
V Hey!  
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Are you okay?  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V Yeah, I'm fine.  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Crazy kids, huh?  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V What?  
p470
tp471
a(V ELAINE 
p472
V Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.    
p473
tp474
a(V MIKE 
p475
V Is that Jerry? Jerry?!  
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V Oh, hey Mike.   George What, you know Jerry?  
p479
tp480
a(V MIKE 
p481
V Yeah, I know Jerry.  
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V How do you know him?  
p485
tp486
a(V MIKE 
p487
V What's the difference?  
p488
tp489
a(V GEORGE 
p490
V Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.   
p491
tp492
a(V MIKE 
p493
V Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real   piece of work!  
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V I'm coming down.  
p497
tp498
a(V MIKE 
p499
V Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?     George, What, you know Kramer?!   Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.  
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Hi.  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V Hello.  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.   
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!

a(V GEORGE 
p514
V And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?    
p515
tp516
a(V MIKE 
p517
V Yeah.  
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V Oh great.  
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V You know that guy downstairs?  
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Yeah, he's a real phony.  
p527
tp528
a(V KRAMER 
p529
V What's going on?!  
p530
tp531
a(V MIKE 
p532
V Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!   
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V It's my space!  
p536
tp537
a(V KRAMER 
p538
V I'll be down in a minute.  
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V Are you going down?  
p542
tp543
a(V KRAMER 
p544
V Yeah.  
p545
tp546
a(V ELAINE 
p547
V Is anything wrong?  
p548
tp549
a(V KRAMER 
p550
V Why should anything be wrong?  
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V Be down in a minute.   Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.  
p554
tp555
a(V MIKE 
p556
V Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if   I have to.  
p557
tp558
a(V GEORGE 
p559
V I'll die out here.   Two bystanders are discussing the incident.   BYSTANDER #1  He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no   longer his space.   BYSTANDER #2  No, it doesn't matter. He was-  
p560
tp561
a(V MIKE 
p562
V Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!  
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.   
p566
tp567
a(V MIKE 
p568
V Hey Krame! You know this guy?  
p569
tp570
a(V KRAMER 
p571
V Yeah, yeah, I know him.  
p572
tp573
a(V MIKE 
p574
V You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of   regimen?  
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much   so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another   fifteen percent.  
p578
tp579
a(V MIKE 
p580
V Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!    I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!   
p581
tp582
a(V GEORGE 
p583
V Oh, come on.  
p584
tp585
a(V MIKE 
p586
V Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.   
p587
tp588
a(V GEORGE 
p589
V Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my   space?  
p590
tp591
a(V MIKE 
p592
V Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.   
p593
tp594
a(V GEORGE 
p595
V You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you   didn't have room to parallel park!  
p596
tp597
a(V MIKE 
p598
V I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if    you pull out I'll show you!  
p599
tp600
a(V GEORGE 
p601
V You've got a prayer.  
p602
tp603
a(V KRAMER 
p604
V I go in front first all the time.  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.    Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Did you talk to him?  
p611
tp612
a(V ELAINE 
p613
V Yeah, it's all taken care of.  
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V You told him? What did you tell him?    
p617
tp618
a(V ELAINE 
p619
V I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have    been there to appreciate it.  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V I don't believe it, what did you say?    
p623
tp624
a(V ELAINE 
p625
V I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and    they followed us into the city.  
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V A pack of teenagers?  
p629
tp630
a(V ELAINE 
p631
V Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved   that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.  
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V You are a genius, it's as simple as that.   
p635
tp636
a(V ELAINE 
p637
V What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it   but, you know it's inborn.   Elaine and George rejoin the others.  
p638
tp639
a(V KRAMER 
p640
V By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.   
p641
tp642
a(V ELAINE 
p643
V What?  
p644
tp645
a(V KRAMER 
p646
V Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.    
p647
tp648
a(V GEORGE 
p649
V Oh great.  
p650
tp651
a(V JERRY 
p652
V I didn't know.  
p653
tp654
a(V ELAINE 
p655
V Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.   
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.   
p659
tp660
a(V MIKE 
p661
V A flea market? You went to a flea market??    
p662
tp663
a(V GEORGE 
p664
V Hey, who's talking to you?  
p665
tp666
a(V ELAINE 
p667
V We just didn't think of you.  
p668
tp669
a(V KRAMER 
p670
V You said it, sister.  
p671
tp672
a(V GEORGE 
p673
V What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know   and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?   People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.  
p674
tp675
a(V GEORGE 
p676
V Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.   
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!   
p680
tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.   
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V You're right. My fault.  
p686
tp687
a(V ELAINE 
p688
V Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.  
p689
tp690
a(V GEORGE 
p691
V Yeah, I'm sorry.  
p692
tp693
a(V KRAMER 
p694
V I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.    
p695
tp696
a(V GEORGE 
p697
V What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that   a good sorry?  
p698
tp699
a(V JERRY 
p700
V It was a so-so sorry.   A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.    TRUCK DRIVER  Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!    
p701
tp702
a(V GEORGE 
p703
V You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.   
p704
tp705
a(V MIKE 
p706
V And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?    TRUCK DRIVER  Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of   ice cream here!   Fade out/in.  
p707
tp708
a(V ELAINE 
p709
V You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through,   right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan   drivers to move them.  
p710
tp711
a(V JERRY 
p712
V Wild pack of teenagers, huh?  
p713
tp714
a(V GEORGE 
p715
V Yeah.  
p716
tp717
a(V JERRY 
p718
V Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.   
p719
tp720
a(V ELAINE 
p721
V Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?   
p722
tp723
a(V GEORGE 
p724
V Uh huh.  
p725
tp726
a(V JERRY 
p727
V Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,   
p728
tp729
a(V GEORGE 
p730
V Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what   you're capable of.  
p731
tp732
a(V ELAINE 
p733
V Right.  
p734
tp735
a(V GEORGE 
p736
V I learned a lot about myself.  
p737
tp738
a(V JERRY 
p739
V What did you do to my car?!  
p740
tp741
a(V GEORGE 
p742
V I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.   
p743
tp744
a(V ELAINE 
p745
V Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.    
p746
tp747
a(V JERRY 
p748
V I thought you said you were a good driver!    
p749
tp750
a(V GEORGE 
p751
V No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.   
p752
tp753
a(V JERRY 
p754
V I think you said driver.  
p755
tp756
a(V GEORGE 
p757
V Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.   
p758
tp759
a(V MIKE 
p760
V Will you move it up a little bit?  
p761
tp762
a(V GEORGE 
p763
V No no no, that's in the right position.    
p764
tp765
a(V MIKE 
p766
V No no, I was further in.  
p767
tp768
a(V GEORGE 
p769
V No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.    
p770
tp771
a(V MIKE 
p772
V Do you mind?  
p773
tp774
a(V GEORGE 
p775
V Do you?  
p776
tp777
a(V SID 
p778
V Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.   
p779
tp780
a(V JERRY 
p781
V Hey Sid.  
p782
tp783
a(V MIKE 
p784
V Who are you?  
p785
tp786
a(V SID 
p787
V Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to   George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets   disrupted and disjointed?  
p788
tp789
a(V GEORGE 
p790
V Sid, it's completely his fault.  
p791
tp792
a(V MIKE 
p793
V Oh, right.  
p794
tp795
a(V SID 
p796
V Why don't you start taking the bus?    
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The   fight's starting in two minutes.  
p800
tp801
a(V GEORGE 
p802
V Don't do it!  
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?   
p806
tp807
a(V GEORGE 
p808
V Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.   
p809
tp810
a(V ELAINE 
p811
V Why don't you just flip a coin already?    
p812
tp813
a(V GEORGE 
p814
V No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that   anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm   making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up   with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with   head first parking.  
p815
tp816
a(V ELAINE 
p817
V You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about   what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.    
p818
tp819
a(V GEORGE 
p820
V So you're against me now?   An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt   store, are discussing the incident.   ANGRY MAN  He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go   in head first.  
p821
tp822
a(V MATTHEW 
p823
V No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.    ANGRY MAN  No he wasn't.  
p824
tp825
a(V MATTHEW 
p826
V All that matters is who was there first.     ANGRY MAN  Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.   
p827
tp828
a(V MATTHEW 
p829
V You just spit on me!   ANGRY MAN  Don't you raise your voice to me!  
p830
tp831
a(V MATTHEW 
p832
V You're not my father.  
p833
tp834
a(V JERRY 
p835
V Hey Matthew.  
p836
tp837
a(V MATTHEW 
p838
V Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.    
p839
tp840
a(V JERRY 
p841
V How ya doing?  
p842
tp843
a(V MATTHEW 
p844
V Okay.  
p845
tp846
a(V JERRY 
p847
V Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.   
p848
tp849
a(V MATTHEW 
p850
V What?!  
p851
tp852
a(V JERRY 
p853
V Oh no, nothing.  
p854
tp855
a(V MATTHEW 
p856
V What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?   
p857
tp858
a(V JERRY 
p859
V No, no, no, no.  
p860
tp861
a(V MATTHEW 
p862
V We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?   
p863
tp864
a(V JERRY 
p865
V No, of course not, of course not!  
p866
tp867
a(V MATTHEW 
p868
V Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of   business. We don't have any money?  
p869
tp870
a(V MARYEDITH 
p871
V Jerry?! What's the matter with you?    
p872
tp873
a(V JERRY 
p874
V I didn't--  
p875
tp876
a(V MARYEDITH 
p877
V Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says   some pretty stupid things sometimes.  
p878
tp879
a(V KRAMER 
p880
V Oh, congratulations.  
p881
tp882
a(V MARYEDITH 
p883
V What for?  
p884
tp885
a(V KRAMER 
p886
V Well, you're pregnant.  
p887
tp888
a(V MARYEDITH 
p889
V What?  
p890
tp891
a(V KRAMER 
p892
V You're not pregnant?  
p893
tp894
a(V MARYEDITH 
p895
V No, I'm not pregnant.  
p896
tp897
a(V KRAMER 
p898
V Are you sure you're not pregnant?  
p899
tp900
a(V MARYEDITH 
p901
V Yes, I'm sure!  
p902
tp903
a(V KRAMER 
p904
V That's weird.  
p905
tp906
a(V MARYEDITH 
p907
V Come on, Matthew.  
p908
tp909
a(V MATTHEW 
p910
V No.  
p911
tp912
a(V MARYEDITH 
p913
V Come on, Matthew!  
p914
tp915
a(V KRAMER 
p916
V I thought she was pregnant.  
p917
tp918
a(V JERRY 
p919
V Hey, do you think I'm phony?  
p920
tp921
a(V ELAINE 
p922
V What?  
p923
tp924
a(V JERRY 
p925
V Mike thinks I'm a phony.  
p926
tp927
a(V ELAINE 
p928
V He thinks you're a phony?  
p929
tp930
a(V JERRY 
p931
V Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell   me.  
p932
tp933
a(V ELAINE 
p934
V Oh, you have to say something.  
p935
tp936
a(V JERRY 
p937
V I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.   
p938
tp939
a(V ELAINE 
p940
V You gotta open the vault.  
p941
tp942
a(V JERRY 
p943
V Open my vault?  
p944
tp945
a(V ELAINE 
p946
V Open your vault.  
p947
tp948
a(V JERRY 
p949
V Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.   
p950
tp951
a(V ELAINE 
p952
V You have no choice.  
p953
tp954
a(V JERRY 
p955
V Oy ga-vault.  
p956
tp957
a(V NEWMAN 
p958
V You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell   you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It   reduces us to jungle law.   George begins applauding.  
p959
tp960
a(V KRAMER 
p961
V When can you park head first?  
p962
tp963
a(V NEWMAN 
p964
V Never.  
p965
tp966
a(V MIKE 
p967
V What are you asking this guy for?  
p968
tp969
a(V NEWMAN 
p970
V Who's talking to you?  
p971
tp972
a(V GEORGE 
p973
V He's right. never.  
p974
tp975
a(V MIKE 
p976
V Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way   up to the front car?  
p977
tp978
a(V NEWMAN 
p979
V Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.    
p980
tp981
a(V GEORGE 
p982
V When do you ever have ten car lengths?    
p983
tp984
a(V KRAMER 
p985
V What about Sundays and holidays?  
p986
tp987
a(V GEORGE 
p988
V Oh please.   A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George,  
p989
tp990
a(V SHEILA 
p991
V What's going on here?  
p992
tp993
a(V GEORGE 
p994
V Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.   
p995
tp996
a(V SHEILA 
p997
V I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away   with it.  
p998
tp999
a(V GEORGE 
p1000
V Well, thank you for your support.  
p1001
tp1002
a(V SHEILA 
p1003
V Hey, that's a great hat.  
p1004
tp1005
a(V GEORGE 
p1006
V Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.   
p1007
tp1008
a(V NEWMAN 
p1009
V Hey George, nice hat.  
p1010
tp1011
a(V GEORGE 
p1012
V Yeah, thanks.  
p1013
tp1014
a(V NEWMAN 
p1015
V Can I try it on?  
p1016
tp1017
a(V GEORGE 
p1018
V No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.  
p1019
tp1020
a(V NEWMAN 
p1021
V Well sure it would.  
p1022
tp1023
a(V GEORGE 
p1024
V No! Get out of here, Newman.  
p1025
tp1026
a(V NEWMAN 
p1027
V Come on, let me try it on.  
p1028
tp1029
a(V GEORGE 
p1030
V No, Newman, stop it.  
p1031
tp1032
a(V SHEILA 
p1033
V Let him try it on.  
p1034
tp1035
a(V GEORGE 
p1036
V I don't want him to!  
p1037
tp1038
a(V SHEILA 
p1039
V What is wrong with you?  
p1040
tp1041
a(V GEORGE 
p1042
V You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There!   There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?!   Here! Try on the hat!  
p1043
tp1044
a(V NEWMAN 
p1045
V Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.   
p1046
tp1047
a(V GEORGE 
p1048
V Alright, just keep the hat!  
p1049
tp1050
a(V JERRY 
p1051
V Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs,   who's coming? Elaine?  
p1052
tp1053
a(V ELAINE

V Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was    sitting there.   COP #1  Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head   first.   COP #2  Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was   just sitting over there.   COP #1  What are you talking about? This guy was here first.    COP #2  But he didn't take it.   COP #1  Hey, it's his space.   COP #2  No, it's his space.   Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing   through the window.
