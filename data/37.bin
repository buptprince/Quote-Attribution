a(V KRAMER

V You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I'll do it!   
p5
tp6
a(V NINA 
p7
V No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do.   
p8
tp9
a(V KRAMER 
p10
V Well, why don't you take your clothes off?   
p11
tp12
a(V NINA 
p13
V I don't know... I don't think Jerry would like that.   
p14
tp15
a(V KRAMER 
p16
V (debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little secret.     Jerry's apartment)  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly!    Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these    things open!  
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V I like the button fly.  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V (incredulous) What?  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking    metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you    doing today?  
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V Nothing.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her    paintings?

tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V I don't get art.  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V There's nothing to get.  
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have    someone explain the explanation.  
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer    right now.  
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V What for?  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V She sees something in him.  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.     Nina's studio again--same scene)  
p56
tp57
a(V KRAMER 
p58
V Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really,    they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.  
p59
tp60
a(V NINA 
p61
V Tell me about Elaine.  
p62
tp63
a(V KRAMER 
p64
V She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.   
p65
tp66
a(V NINA 
p67
V But, they're still friends.  
p68
tp69
a(V KRAMER 
p70
V Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).   
p71
tp72
a(V NINA 
p73
V Don't you think that's strange?  
p74
tp75
a(V KRAMER 
p76
V Why, what's the difference?  
p77
tp78
a(V NINA 
p79
V Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?   
p80
tp81
a(V KRAMER 
p82
V Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.     the door outside Nina's studio)  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V You know, I'm a little nervous.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V Why?  
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm    getting fixed up for a friendship.  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V I don't know how long this is gonna last.   
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V Really? I thought you liked her.  
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having    fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)  
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not    obligated to buy anything, am I?   (Nina opens the door)  
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.   
p107
tp108
a(V NINA 
p109
V How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)   
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!   
p113
tp114
a(V KRAMER 
p115
V Yeah!  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.   
p119
tp120
a(V NINA 
p121
V Oh, are you interested?  
p122
tp123
a(V GEORGE 
p124
V (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.   
p125
tp126
a(V KRAMER 
p127
V George, you gonna buy a painting?  
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.  
p131
tp132
a(V NINA 
p133
V Are you an art-lover?  
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V I am an art-adorer! I adore art.  
p137
tp138
a(V NINA 
p139
V Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like.    (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to    the painting-in-progress (Kramer) and picks up a brush.)  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)   
p143
tp144
a(V NINA 
p145
V (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands    Jerry a small white envelope)  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V What's this?  
p149
tp150
a(V NINA 
p151
V My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday    afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going    out of town.  
p155
tp156
a(V NINA 
p157
V Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?   
p158
tp159
a(V KRAMER 
p160
V (immediately) Yeah.  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!   
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?   
p167
tp168
a(V NINA 
p169
V Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.   
p170
tp171
a(V GEORGE 
p172
V All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!   
p173
tp174
a(V NINA 
p175
V (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-    ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?    Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead    to their seats)  
p176
tp177
a(V GEORGE 
p178
V Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not    stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher     abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?    
p179
tp180
a(V USHER 
p181
V No, no, these are your seats.  
p182
tp183
a(V GEORGE 
p184
V She said first row! Right behind the dugout!   
p185
tp186
a(V ELAINE 
p187
V Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.   
p188
tp189
a(V GEORGE 
p190
V I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up    on the dugout!  
p191
tp192
a(V ELAINE 
p193
V Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than    this.  
p194
tp195
a(V GEORGE 
p196
V Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right    there, that's better.  
p197
tp198
a(V KRAMER 
p199
V Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer    hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!  
p200
tp201
a(V ELAINE 
p202
V I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.   
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V (amused) You're supposed to do that?    
p206
tp207
a(V ELAINE 
p208
V (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to    go to a circumcision?  
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V I'd rather go to a hanging.  
p212
tp213
a(V ELAINE 
p214
V Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father    in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)  
p215
tp216
a(V KRAMER 
p217
V (screaming at the players on the field)  YOU BETTER CATCH IT,    JOHNNY, 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T PHILIDELPHIA!!    (a man approaches the trio)  
p218
tp219
a(V MAN 
p220
V George?  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V Yeah?  
p224
tp225
a(V MAN 
p226
V Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.    
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--    
p230
tp231
a(V ELAINE 
p232
V Hi!  
p233
tp234
a(V KRAMER 
p235
V (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA  CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!   
p236
tp237
a(V GEORGE 
p238
V --and this is Kramer.  
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V Oh, hey.   (the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds)  
p242
tp243
a(V WEST 
p244
V So how are the seats?  
p245
tp246
a(V GEORGE 
p247
V Okay.  
p248
tp249
a(V ELAINE 
p250
V Great, great.  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V Yeah.  
p254
tp255
a(V WEST 
p256
V George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.   
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs.    (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?  
p260
tp261
a(V WEST 
p262
V Well, if you have a lot of money.   (Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds)  
p263
tp264
a(V WEST 
p265
V (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you    better take off that Orioles cap.  
p266
tp267
a(V ELAINE 
p268
V (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!    
p269
tp270
a(V WEST 
p271
V No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't    think it's a good idea.  
p272
tp273
a(V ELAINE 
p274
V You're not serious.  
p275
tp276
a(V WEST 
p277
V Yes, yes, yes, I am!  
p278
tp279
a(V ELAINE 
p280
V Well, did he say that?  
p281
tp282
a(V WEST 
p283
V No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if    you wore an Orioles cap.  
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Well maybe you should ask him!  
p287
tp288
a(V WEST 
p289
V I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or    not?  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This    is ridiculous!!  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V Just take the cap off.  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!   
p299
tp300
a(V WEST 
p301
V Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.   
p302
tp303
a(V ELAINE 
p304
V Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.   
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V Just take the cap off!  
p308
tp309
a(V ELAINE 
p310
V No!   (a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off    GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security     over, they proceed to remove Elaine)  
p311
tp312
a(V KRAMER 
p313
V Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?   
p317
tp318
a(V KRAMER 
p319
V (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.    
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V (sarcastically, to George) Stay!  
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Okay, we'll go!   (meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the    camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer   
p326

a(V IS 
p328
V the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto     the crowd)   END OF ACT 1    =============================================================================     ACT 2    (Jerry's apartment--day)  
p329
tp330
a(V ELAINE 
p331
V ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over    the railing!  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Is he okay?  
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you    know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!    
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you    to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!  
p341
tp342
a(V ELAINE 
p343
V I know! Can you imagine that?   (Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead)  
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V How you feeling?  
p347
tp348
a(V KRAMER 
p349
V Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey,    we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're    all in the picture.  
p350
tp351
a(V ELAINE 
p352
V Wha- a picture?  
p353
tp354
a(V KRAMER 
p355
V A picture.  
p356
tp357
a(V ELAINE 
p358
V OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??   
p359
tp360
a(V KRAMER 
p361
V Uh-huh.   (they all crowd around, looking at the picture)  
p362
tp363
a(V ELAINE 
p364
V (gasps) I cannot believe this!  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V (pointing) There's George!  
p368
tp369
a(V KRAMER 
p370
V Yup, yup!  
p371
tp372
a(V ELAINE 
p373
V Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father!    Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in    the paper!    Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.)   
p374
tp375
a(V ELAINE 
p376
V Hi, Mr. Lippman.  
p377
tp378
a(V LIPPMAN 
p379
V How's your father?  
p380
tp381
a(V ELAINE 
p382
V My, my father?  
p383
tp384
a(V LIPPMAN 
p385
V Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?    
p386
tp387
a(V ELAINE 
p388
V Yeah.  
p389
tp390
a(V LIPPMAN 
p391
V Uh-huh.  
p392
tp393
a(V ELAINE 
p394
V I went to visit him.  
p395
tp396
a(V LIPPMAN 
p397
V Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?    
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...   
p401
tp402
a(V LIPPMAN 
p403
V But--but he's feeling better now?  
p404
tp405
a(V ELAINE 
p406
V Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have    buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.  
p407
tp408
a(V LIPPMAN 
p409
V (correcting her) Boo-eed.  
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V What--what did I say?  
p413
tp414
a(V LIPPMAN 
p415
V You said "boyed."  
p416
tp417
a(V ELAINE 
p418
V I did?  
p419
tp420
a(V LIPPMAN 
p421
V Yeah.   (Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly removes    Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver it into her    lap, out of sight.)  
p422
tp423
a(V LIPPMAN 
p424
V Well, I got a plane to catch.  
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V Oh! Where are you going?  
p428
tp429
a(V LIPPMAN 
p430
V Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have    my sports section?  
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Ah. ...Yeah.  
p434
tp435
a(V LIPPMAN 
p436
V I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports    section.  
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the    Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...  
p440
tp441
a(V LIPPMAN 
p442
V Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine    holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?  
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD    time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news-    papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)  
p446
tp447
a(V LIPPMAN 
p448
V Gotta go.  
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat)    I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!    Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's "Kramer.")    MRS.ARM  I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an    innocent orphan in the post-modern world.   MR. ARM  I see a parasite.   MRS.ARM  A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his    most basic and immediate urges.    Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.)   
p452
tp453
a(V NINA 
p454
V She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.   
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap    at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?    Armstrongs admiring painting again.)     MRS.ARM  He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!    MR. ARM  He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.     Jerry and Nina again.)  
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we    should just end this before we really start hating each other.    
p461
tp462
a(V NINA 
p463
V Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to    remain friends!  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!   
p467
tp468
a(V NINA 
p469
V Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George.    Tell him he owes me $500!    Armstrongs)   MRS.ARM  He transcends time and space.   MR. ARM  He sickens me.   MRS.ARM  I love it.   MR. ARM  Me too.    Jerry's apartment.)  
p470
tp471
a(V GEORGE 
p472
V Five-hundred dollars?! What?  
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V That's what she told me!  
p476
tp477
a(V GEORGE 
p478
V I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!   
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V That's what it costs!  
p482
tp483
a(V GEORGE 
p484
V Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!   
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V I wasn't thinking! I don't know.  
p488

V Well, she framed it and everything.    
p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!    (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly     lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some-    thing!  
p500
tp501
a(V GEORGE 
p502
V I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a    different story.

a(V KRAMER

p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there,    Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing    I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything     I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists,    because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness     and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-    ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."  
p533
tp534
a(V GEORGE 
p535
V WOW!

a(V JERRY 
p541
V (reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not    going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and    people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"     (Kramer blows his noes loudly) "...because I'm sure as hell fighting     for you!"  
p542
tp543
a(V KRAMER 
p544
V You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!    
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about    her!  
p548
tp549
a(V KRAMER 
p550
V (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a    call. Pick up the phone and call her!  
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V Should I?  
p554
tp555
a(V KRAMER 
p556
V (screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight    for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!  
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.      Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her    coat. The TV is on a horse race.)  
p560

p569
tp570
a(V NINA 
p571
V What's the appeal of the posse?  
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away    from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a    week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.   (George enters)  
p575
tp576
a(V NINA

a(V NINA 
p583
V Well, I really love that piece.  
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact,    I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you!    Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know    what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.  
p587
tp588
a(V NINA 
p589
V No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!   
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should    really be in a doormanned building.  
p593
tp594
a(V NINA 
p595
V Honestly, George, the money's not important.    
p596

a(V NINA

p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing    to George) He likes the pop-in, too.  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622

p623

p649
V (to Nina) Hello!   (Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine)  
p650
tp651
a(V ELAINE 
p652
V (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll    be fired!  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!   
p656
tp657
a(V ELAINE 
p658
V No, he wants to torture me.    later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.    Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.)    
p659
tp660
a(V ELAINE 
p661
V (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the    clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, insti-    gating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)    
p662
tp663
a(V JERRY 
p664
V (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back)    Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.  
p665
tp666
a(V ELAINE 
p667
V You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never    seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.     (another tug-o-war starts)  
p668
tp669
a(V JERRY 
p670
V Let go!  
p671
tp672
a(V ELAINE 
p673
V No, come on! I want it, Jerry!  
p674
tp675
a(V JERRY 
p676
V Let go, Elaine!  
p677
tp678
a(V ELAINE 
p679
V Well at least let George do it!  
p680
tp681
a(V JERRY 
p682
V Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)   
p683
tp684
a(V GEORGE 
p685
V (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally    gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.   (George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing Neil Simon's    Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes the station)   
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little    longer)  
p689
tp690
a(V ELAINE 
p691
V It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.  
p692
tp693
a(V JERRY 
p694
V (on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV    for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!  
p695
tp696
a(V ELAINE 
p697
V What letter?  
p698
tp699
a(V JERRY 
p700
V This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!     (Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts    reading in unison with movie on TV.)  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V "...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness    still know that I love you!!"  
p704
tp705
a(V GEORGE 
p706
V This is incredible!  
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She cop-     ied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!    
p710
tp711
a(V GEORGE 
p712
V Maybe I won't send her that check.    
p713
tp714
a(V ELAINE 
p715
V You know, it's not really that terrible.    
p716
tp717
a(V JERRY 
p718
V What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!    (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness!     James Caan doesn't offer happiness!    Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and    places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave     but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room)   
p719
tp720
a(V LIPPMAN 
p721
V (into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat)    But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's     unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take    care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West,    my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees     too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw    him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter.     She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some    friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore     cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?  
p722
tp723
a(V ELAINE 
p724
V Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.   
p725
tp726
a(V LIPPMAN 
p727
V Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?    
p728
tp729
a(V ELAINE 
p730
V Well, uh, fan. My father--  
p731
tp732
a(V LIPPMAN 
p733
V Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!   
p734
tp735
a(V ELAINE 
p736
V Really?  
p737
tp738
a(V LIPPMAN 
p739
V Yeah.  
p740
tp741
a(V ELAINE 
p742
V So... impudent.  
p743
tp744
a(V LIPPMAN 
p745
V Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting    Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.  
p746
tp747
a(V ELAINE 
p748
V (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--   
p749
tp750
a(V LIPPMAN 
p751
V Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.   
p752
tp753
a(V ELAINE 
p754
V (very reluctant) Okay.  
p755
tp756
a(V LIPPMAN 
p757
V Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore    cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with    him.  
p758
tp759
a(V ELAINE 
p760
V That will be fun.      Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her,    sitting on the sofa.)  
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V How's it coming?  
p764
tp765
a(V NINA 
p766
V Good, good.  
p767
tp768
a(V JERRY 
p769
V Seen any good movies lately?  
p770
tp771
a(V NINA 
p772
V No... not really. You?  
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil    Simon?  
p776
tp777
a(V NINA 
p778
V Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.    
p779
tp780
a(V JERRY 
p781
V I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh...    Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?  
p782
tp783
a(V NINA 
p784
V I don't know... maybe.  
p785
tp786
a(V JERRY 
p787
V I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night.    Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help    notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens    answer the door...)   MR. ARM  Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."     Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball    game and talking.)  
p788
tp789
a(V GEORGE 
p790
V Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)   
p791
tp792
a(V JERRY 
p793
V Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!    
p794
tp795
a(V GEORGE 
p796
V So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?   
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can    you get this thing outta my house?  
p800
tp801
a(V GEORGE 
p802
V Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right    now for ten bucks.   (the Yankees announcer is heard on TV)  
p803
tp804
a(V TVVOICE 
p805
V Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the    Yankee dugout.  
p806
tp807
a(V GEORGE 
p808
V Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.   
p809
tp810
a(V TVVOICE 
p811
V Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind     of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it    with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting    the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers?     Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."   (Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.)    the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having    Kramer over for dinner.)  
p812
tp813
a(V KRAMER 
p814
V ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a    steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.     MRS.ARM  More potatoes?  
p815
tp816
a(V KRAMER 
p817
V Yeah, sure. Please.   MR. ARM  Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?
