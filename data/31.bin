V  THE SUICIDE  Written by Tom Leopold     (Comedy club)   The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I say, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.    (Jerry's Apartment)   Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?

a(V JERRY

V What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.   
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?     (buzzer)  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Yeah.  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V It's George.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?   
p20
tp21
a(V ELAINE 
p22
V I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?    
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V I think I'll take out the garbage.    
p26
tp27
a(V ELAINE 
p28
V Hey, have you ever fasted?  
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.   
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V Yeah, right.  
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V Come on, it's just down the hall.  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.   
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V I'll give you 50 cents.  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.   
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake   
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.    
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?   
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.   
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.     (Gina enters the hall)

p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?   
p74
tp75
a(V GINA 
p76
V Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.   
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V How much do they cost?  
p80
tp81
a(V GINA 
p82
V The junior?  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V No, no the full size.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V No, no the junior.  
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V You didn't say "junior".  
p92
tp93
a(V GINA 
p94
V I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?   
p98
tp99
a(V MARTIN 
p100
V Good enough.   (MARTIN leaves with Gina)  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V Boy she's sexy isn't she?   (Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer's apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry's apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)   
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V Do you believe that guy?  
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V What guy?  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V My neighbour:  
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V Oh, that creepy guy?  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?   
p119
tp120
a(V GEORGE 
p121
V He didn't seem too pleased.  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.   
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V What's so amazing? You've seen him before.    
p131
tp132
a(V GEORGE 
p133
V I haven't seen him for months.  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V What was the dream?  
p137
tp138
a(V GEORGE 
p139
V I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.   
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V I think I've played there.  
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.   
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V You're a little paranormal  
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.   
p152
tp153
a(V GEORGE 
p154
V Really?  
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V Uh uh, you should go some time.  
p158
tp159
a(V GEORGE 
p160
V I'd love to go. Make an appointment.    
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?   
p164
tp165
a(V GEORGE 
p166
V I just got fired.  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V Alright, come on, lets get out of here.    
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.   
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.   
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Really?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.   (They exit)   (Jerry's apartment late at night there is knocking at the door)    
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Who is it? Who is it?  
p185
tp186
a(V GINA 
p187
V It's Gina.  
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V Who?  
p191
tp192
a(V GINA 
p193
V Martine's girl friend.  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Martine?  
p197
tp198
a(V GINA 
p199
V You next door neighbour.  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Oh, Martin!   (Jerry opens door)  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.    
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V What?  
p209
tp210
a(V GINA 
p211
V Come on.  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V In my pajamas? I better get my robe.    
p215
tp216
a(V GINA 
p217
V We don't have enough time.  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V It'll take two seconds.  
p221
tp222
a(V GINA 
p223
V There is no time.  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V We don't have two seconds?  
p227
tp228
a(V GINA 
p229
V All right. Go ahead.  
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V Nah, forget it.  
p233
tp234
a(V GINA 
p235
V No, go ahead.  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.  
p239
tp240
a(V GINA 
p241
V Will you just get it.  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Are you sure?  
p245
tp246
a(V GINA 
p247
V Forget it. Come on.  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V Nah, I'll go get the robe.   (Metropolitan Hospital Center)  
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.    
p254
tp255
a(V GINA 
p256
V You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.   
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V Really? It's over?  
p260
tp261
a(V GINA 
p262
V I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.   
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265
V Oh boy, did he say anything about me?    
p266
tp267
a(V GINA 
p268
V He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.   
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V He said that?  
p272
tp273
a(V GINA 
p274
V He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.   
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.   
p278
tp279
a(V GINA 
p280
V I wasn't.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V You weren't?  
p284
tp285
a(V GINA 
p286
V No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?   
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Of course.  
p290
tp291
a(V GINA 
p292
V Tell me everything.  
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V Are you sure he can't hear anything?  . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.   
p296
tp297
a(V GINA 
p298
V I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.   
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.   
p302
tp303
a(V GINA 
p304
V I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.   
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V No, I just wanted to see what time it was.   
p308
tp309
a(V GINA 
p310
V Are you afraid of him?  
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V No.  
p314
tp315
a(V GINA 
p316
V Then kiss me.  
p317
tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V Here?  
p320
tp321
a(V GINA 
p322
V Yes, right here.  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Is this the proper venue?  
p326
tp327
a(V GINA 
p328
V You don't want to?  
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.    
p332
tp333
a(V GINA 
p334
V Then kiss me right in front of him.    
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V I can't. What if he wakes up?  
p338
tp339
a(V GINA 
p340
V A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?   
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it.    (Jerry's apartment)  
p344
tp345
a(V KRAMER 
p346
V Hey.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V Hey.  
p350
tp351
a(V KRAMER 
p352
V Did you hear about Martin?  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V Yeah, I heard.  
p356
tp357
a(V KRAMER 
p358
V I can't believe he's in a coma.  
p359
tp360
a(V KRAMER 
p361
V He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?   
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Who told you about Martin?  
p365
tp366
a(V KRAMER 
p367
V Newman! He's good friends with him.     Jx; Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.  
p368
tp369
a(V KRAMER 
p370
V He's got all of my attachments, you know.   
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?   
p374
tp375
a(V KRAMER 
p376
V What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?   
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?   
p380
tp381
a(V KRAMER 
p382
V So what's going on between you and Gina?    
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.   
p386
tp387
a(V KRAMER 
p388
V Uh, uh.  
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.   
p392
tp393
a(V KRAMER 
p394
V Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?   
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Nothing.  
p398
tp399
a(V KRAMER 
p400
V Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?    
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.   
p404
tp405
a(V KRAMER 
p406
V There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.   
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.    
p410
tp411
a(V KRAMER 
p412
V I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.   
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?   
p416
tp417
a(V KRAMER 
p418
V NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.    (The psychic's apartment)  
p419
tp420
a(V RULA 
p421
V Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.    
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V Why would he come to George?  
p425
tp426
a(V RULA 
p427
V Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER  OUT OF YOUR NOSE.   
p428
tp429
a(V GEORGE 
p430
V I knew it. I always felt different.    
p431
tp432
a(V RULA 
p433
V You are. Some coffee cake?  
p434
tp435
a(V GEORGE 
p436
V Drakes?  
p437
tp438
a(V RULA 
p439
V Yes.  
p440
tp441
a(V GEORGE 
p442
V Did you buy this for me?  
p443
tp444
a(V RULA 
p445
V No, why?  
p446
tp447
a(V GEORGE 
p448
V Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.    
p449
tp450
a(V RULA 
p451
V Maybe I did.  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V Take it away.  
p455
tp456
a(V GEORGE 
p457
V She hasn't eaten in two days.  
p458
tp459
a(V RULA 
p460
V Who's Pauline?  
p461
tp462
a(V GEORGE 
p463
V Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.   
p464
tp465
a(V RULA 
p466
V Do you think about her?  
p467
tp468
a(V GEORGE 
p469
V When I hear her name mentioned.  
p470
tp471
a(V RULA 
p472
V Cut these with your left hand.  
p473
tp474
a(V GEORGE 
p475
V There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.   
p476
tp477
a(V RULA 
p478
V I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.    
p479
tp480
a(V GEORGE 
p481
V Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?   
p482
tp483
a(V RULA 
p484
V Not in this life.  
p485
tp486
a(V ELAINE 
p487
V Should you be smoking?  
p488
tp489
a(V RULA 
p490
V Does it bother you?  
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V You're pregnant.  
p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V Elaine.  
p497
tp498
a(V RULA 
p499
V I smoked when I had Faisy.  
p500
tp501
a(V RULA 
p502
V Ah oh.  
p503
tp504
a(V GEORGE 
p505
V Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?  
p506
tp507
a(V RULA 
p508
V I don't know about this trip George.    
p509
tp510
a(V GEORGE 
p511
V You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?   
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.   
p515
tp516
a(V GEORGE 
p517
V Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.   
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V Should I not go on this trip?  
p521
tp522
a(V RULA 
p523
V George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.    
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.   
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V Elaine, what are you doing?  
p530
tp531
a(V ELAINE 
p532
V It's disgusting.  
p533
tp534
a(V RULA 
p535
V I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.   
p536
tp537
a(V ELAINE 
p538
V Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.   
p539
tp540
a(V RULA 
p541
V Get the hell out.   (Elaine leaving) 
p542

p563
tp564
a(V GINA 
p565
V It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?   
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY

a(V JERRY 
p598
V Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.

a(V JERRY

V I have a carpet sweeper you can use.    
p701
