V  THE GOOD SAMARITAN  Written by Peter Mehlman     (Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in her   bed)    You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the   speaker?  
p2
tp3
a(V JERRY 
p4
V It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.    (Driver cuts in front of Jerry) 
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V Oh look at this guy.  
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V What's goin' on?  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask   permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.  
p14
tp15
a(V ELAINE 
p16
V Did you get a thank you wave?  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy!   Where's my thank you wave?   (Jerry sticks his head out the window) 
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V Give me that wave!  
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V Jerry, are you free on Friday?  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V Yeah, I'm free, why?  
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have   dinner with her and her husband.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into   a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!  
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V You gotta follow that car!  
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V What?!  
p41
tp42
a(V ELAINE 
p43
V You can't let him get away with that!    
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.    
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V What are you, yellow?  
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)    
p53
tp54
a(V ELAINE 
p55
V Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.   
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V Wait, he stopped, he's parking.  
p59
tp60
a(V ELAINE 
p61
V What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?     (Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other   driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman)   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks   back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed   that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance   of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion   steering. (They both smile flirtatiously at each other)     (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by the   table) 
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.   
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.   
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she   left, she reached out and touched my arm.   (Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate) 
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)   
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is   that?  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V Let's not even analyze it.   (Jerry begins walking towards door) 
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V So you didn't turn her in?  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.   
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V Gonna see her again?  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Friday night.   (Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button) 
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Yep.  
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V It's me!  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V Come on up.   (Jerry unlocks and opens door) 
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.   
p107
tp108
a(V GEORGE 
p109
V Hey, hey, hey! I dig.   (George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups) 
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V Oh, you dig?  
p113
tp114
a(V GEORGE 
p115
V Yes! I see enormous potential here.    
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Why?   (George pours two cups of milk) 
p119
tp120
a(V GEORGE 
p121
V Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.   That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a   good meeting story.  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.   
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V I don't think so.  
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for   mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!    (Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent) 
p131
tp132
a(V JERRY 
p133
V On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date   again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for   the rest of your life?!   (Jerry looks at his cup in disgust) 
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V What am I drinking, milk?   (Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket) 
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V Hey!  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Hi.   (Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry) 
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V Sweater.  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Thank you.  
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V So? What happened?   (Jerry starts walking away) 
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V With that?  
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V With the car!  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V What car?  
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V The hit and run!  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run.   Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.  
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?    
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)    (George walks out of the kitchen) 
p173
tp174
a(V GEORGE 
p175
V Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.   
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V Yeah, Queens.  
p179
tp180
a(V ELAINE 
p181
V So? Then what?  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that   car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"   (Elaine gasps) 
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."     (Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement) 
p188
tp189
a(V ELAINE 
p190
V I am speechless. I am without speech.    
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V Tell her about the shoving.  
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V What?   (George smiles pointing at him) 
p197
tp198
a(V ELAINE 
p199
V What shoving?!  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Oh, it was nothing.  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V No! Tell her.   (Jerry looks at George with a grin) 
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the   car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does   two punches)  
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V You know karate??  
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V I know a little.  
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?   
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.     (Kramer enters) 
p221
tp222
a(V KRAMER 
p223
V Hey! (Group does likewise)  
p224
tp225
a(V ELAINE 
p226
V Did you tell Kramer?  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)   
p230
tp231
a(V KRAMER 
p232
V What? What? What? Tell me.  
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE 
p235
V Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.    (Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)  
p236
tp237
a(V KRAMER 
p238
V Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like   that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing   a finger at Jerry)  
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V They should be sent to Australia.   (Jerry has a confused look) 
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Australia?  
p245
tp246
a(V KRAMER 
p247
V Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.   
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V But not any more.  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V No.   (Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer) 
p254
tp255
a(V ELAINE 
p256
V Hey Kramer, Kramer!  
p257
tp258
a(V KRAMER 
p259
V Yeah?  
p260
tp261
a(V ELAINE 
p262
V What happened to you right here? (She's pointing to her forehead)   
p263
tp264
a(V KRAMER 
p265
V I don't know!   (Jerry smiles and shakes his head) 
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I   got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.    (Elaine has a look of surprise) 
p269
tp270
a(V ELAINE 
p271
V Well, that is, that is strange.  
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V Yep. (Mumbles off)   (Elaine walks toward door) 
p275
tp276
a(V ELAINE 
p277
V Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?   
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.    (Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry) 
p281
tp282
a(V ELAINE 
p283
V But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)   
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V We just met.   (Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger) 
p287
tp288
a(V KRAMER 
p289
V Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.    
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V But I, I can't go alone!  
p293
tp294
a(V JERRY 
p295
V Ask George to go with you.  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V George, come on! I'll pay for you.    
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V You'll pay? I'm there.  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V Why do you even need anybody?  
p305
tp306
a(V ELAINE 
p307
V Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple.   Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're   always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine.   You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing   the door to leave)     (Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple,   Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating   his meal) 
p308
tp309
a(V ROBIN 
p310
V You went out with a bullfighter?  
p311
tp312
a(V ELAINE 
p313
V Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.  
p314
tp315
a(V MICHAEL 
p316
V Wow.  
p317
tp318
a(V ROBIN 
p319
V What was his name?  
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.    (George points across the table) 
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Pass the salt please.  
p326
tp327
a(V ROBIN 
p328
V Where did you meet him?  
p329
tp330
a(V ELAINE 
p331
V Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is   that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the   bull, they avoid fighting the bull.   (Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread) 
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V Bread.   (Elaine hands bread to George) 
p335
tp336
a(V ELAINE 
p337
V I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do   learn about life.   (Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks at   Michael) 
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V God bless you.   (Robin smiles) 
p341
tp342
a(V ROBIN 
p343
V Thank you.  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't   going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)   (Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)     (Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both   eating an ice cream cones) 
p347
tp348
a(V WOMAN 
p349
V You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.   
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very   good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.   
p353
tp354
a(V WOMAN 
p355
V Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he   left a note after smacking into a car.   (Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling) 
p359
tp360
a(V WOMAN 
p361
V Come here.     (Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between   Michael and George) 
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V Really, I was, I was only kidding around.    
p365
tp366
a(V ROBIN 
p367
V He was only joking Michael.   (Michael throws down his serviette) 
p368
tp369
a(V MICHAEL 
p370
V You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?   
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not   special.  
p374
tp375
a(V ROBIN 
p376
V He was only joking Michael! Sorry.    
p377
tp378
a(V MICHAEL 
p379
V All right! Take his side!  
p380
tp381
a(V ROBIN 
p382
V I am not taking his side.  
p383
tp384
a(V MICHAEL 
p385
V Well who's side are you taking?!  
p386
tp387
a(V ROBIN 
p388
V Well I'm not taking your side!   (Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)      (Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman are   now kissing) 
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an   unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note.   He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can   exchange license, registration, and apologize.   (Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)     (Scene moves back to Jerry apartment with George talking outside Jerry room,   where Jerry is) 
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?   
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in   with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first   refusal.   (George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and   presses the button) 
p398
tp399
a(V ELAINE 
p400
V It's me.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Come on up.   (Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen) 
p404
tp405
a(V GEORGE 
p406
V Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes   on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's   holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.   
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed   again later, and it was also a single.  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V What if she's having an off night?     (Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa) 
p416
tp417
a(V ELAINE 
p418
V Hi!   Jerry. Hi.   (Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen) 
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!     (George walks out of kitchen) 
p422
tp423
a(V GEORGE 
p424
V Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I   was raised to say 'God bless you'.   (Jerry sneezes) 
p425
tp426
a(V GEORGE 
p427
V Ah, shut up.  
p428
tp429
a(V ELAINE 
p430
V What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid   'stuperstition'.   (Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa) 
p431
tp432
a(V JERRY 
p433
V A stupid what?   (Elaine looks at Jerry) 
p434
tp435
a(V ELAINE 
p436
V Whatever.  
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze,   you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good   lookin''.   (Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes) 
p440
tp441
a(V ELAINE 
p442
V Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a   message on my machine, she wants you to call her.  
p443
tp444
a(V GEORGE 
p445
V Who?  
p446
tp447
a(V ELAINE 
p448
V Robin!   (George looks quickly at Elaine) 
p449
tp450
a(V GEORGE 
p451
V Why?!  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.    (George stands up) 
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V Entertainment Tonight's on.  
p458
tp459
a(V GEORGE 
p460
V Where's the remote phone?  
p461
tp462
a(V JERRY 
p463
V Bedroom.   (George walks toward Jerry's bedroom) 
p464
tp465
a(V ELAINE 
p466
V Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?    (Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, then   walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart   starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)  
p467
tp468
a(V JERRY 
p469
V What's it like out?   (Kramer continues to shake behind sofa) 
p470
tp471
a(V ELAINE 
p472
V Chilly out.  
p473
tp474
a(V JERRY 
p475
V Can I take a sweater?  
p476
tp477
a(V ELAINE 
p478
V Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.   
p479
tp480
a(V JERRY 
p481
V Scarf?  
p482
tp483
a(V ELAINE 
p484
V Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.     (Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes) 
p485
tp486
a(V JERRY 
p487
V What's the matter? What's going on?     (Kramer is looking around like he's lost) 
p488
tp489
a(V KRAMER 
p490
V What happened?!  
p491
tp492
a(V ELAINE 
p493
V What?  
p494
tp495
a(V KRAMER 
p496
V I think I hit my head again!  
p497
tp498
a(V JERRY 
p499
V What is wrong?!   (Elaine is pointing at the TV) 
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last   time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V Yeah.   (Elaine claps her hands together then stands up) 
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V That is it!  
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V What?   (Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him) 
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something   about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like,   just like that woman in Albany!   (George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)  
p515
tp516
a(V KRAMER 
p517
V Mary Hart!  
p518
tp519
a(V GEORGE 
p520
V God.  
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V What?  
p524
tp525
a(V GEORGE 
p526
V Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get   together Wednesday afternoon.  
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V Get together?  
p530
tp531
a(V GEORGE 
p532
V Maybe she just wants to talk to me?    
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.    (George walks to other side of sofa) 
p536
tp537
a(V GEORGE 
p538
V Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and   martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me   any money.   (George sits on chair) 
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V Are you actually considering this?    
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!   
p545
tp546
a(V ELAINE 
p547
V Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a   note.   (Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable) 
p548
tp549
a(V JERRY 
p550
V Yeah.   (Kramer walks out of washroom) 
p551
tp552
a(V KRAMER 
p553
V Hey, you know who owns that car?  
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V What car?  
p557
tp558
a(V KRAMER 
p559
V The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.   
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V Yeah who?  
p563
tp564
a(V KRAMER 
p565
V That blond across the street. You know the one with the long   ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.   (Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen) 
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.    (Elaine nods, smiling) 
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.    (Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows) 
p572
tp573
a(V KRAMER 
p574
V Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?    (Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)  
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V The blond with the blue sweatpants!    
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V Well, who is she?  
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to   approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.   
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't   say anything because of Angela.   (Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)   
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person   does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually   owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this   to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!   (Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)   
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V You can't compromise your principles!    
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V How am I going to live with myself?!    
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V Can't live!  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!   
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V This country needs more people like you!   
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick   and Harry in great personal risk.  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V I believe strongly in that as you know.    
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V There should be more people like us.    
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V That's why the world's in the shape it's in.   
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V You're telling me.   (Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their   magazines)     (Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the girl   with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door) 
p620
tp621
a(V JERRY 
p622
V Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I   can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or   something very close to that.   (Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling) 
p623
tp624
a(V BECKY 
p625
V Well God bless you.   (Jerry pauses) 
p626
tp627
a(V JERRY 
p628
V Thank you very much.     (Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together in   bed) 
p629
tp630
a(V GEORGE 
p631
V Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?   
p632
tp633
a(V ROBIN 
p634
V Oh no, what's wrong?  
p635
tp636
a(V GEORGE 
p637
V What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!   
p638
tp639
a(V ROBIN 
p640
V You didn't commit adultery, I did.    
p641
tp642
a(V GEORGE 
p643
V Oh yeah.  
p644
tp645
a(V ROBIN 
p646
V If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.   
p647
tp648
a(V GEORGE 
p649
V Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of   losers out there.  
p650
tp651
a(V ROBIN 
p652
V Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.   
p653
tp654
a(V GEORGE 
p655
V Well, that's a given.  
p656
tp657
a(V ROBIN 
p658
V In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.   
p659
tp660
a(V GEORGE 
p661
V Must be hell living in that house.       (Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone to   Michael) 
p662
tp663
a(V MICHAEL 
p664
V Hi, it's Michael.  
p665
tp666
a(V ELAINE 
p667
V Hi, Michael!  
p668
tp669
a(V MICHAEL 
p670
V Is Robin there?  
p671
tp672
a(V ELAINE 
p673
V Robin? No, why?  
p674
tp675
a(V MICHAEL 
p676
V Uh, she said she was going to be with you.   
p677
tp678
a(V ELAINE 
p679
V No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter   of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I   have the note, uh, right here.   (Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)   
p680
tp681
a(V MICHAEL 
p682
V If she's not with you, then where is she?   
p683
tp684
a(V ELAINE 
p685
V Well I, I don't know.  
p686
tp687
a(V MICHAEL 
p688
V Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!   
p689
tp690
a(V ELAINE 
p691
V No, no, come on Michael!  
p692
tp693
a(V MICHAEL 
p694
V He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to   twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his   joints, and reattach them!   (Michael sneezes) 
p695
tp696
a(V ELAINE 
p697
V You're soo good lookin'.     (Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking   by the sofa) 
p698
tp699
a(V ANGELA 
p700
V Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I   will carve my initials in your brain tissue!  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V Let me rephra-  
p704
tp705
a(V ANGELA 
p706
V I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll   have a party on your head!   (Elaine walks in) 
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V Hi Elaine, this is Angela.  
p710
tp711
a(V ANGELA 
p712
V I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!    (Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen) 
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V Well I think I get the gist of it.    
p716
tp717
a(V ANGELA 
p718
V So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!    (Jerry shrugs) 
p719
tp720
a(V JERRY 
p721
V What car?   (Jerry hands Angela her purse) 
p722
tp723
a(V ANGELA 
p724
V Good. I'm glad we understand each other.    
p725
tp726
a(V JERRY 
p727
V It's not complicated.   (Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves) 
p728
tp729
a(V ELAINE 
p730
V Very nice meeting you!   (Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)   
p731
tp732
a(V ELAINE 
p733
V Come on up.   (Elaine laughs) 
p734
tp735
a(V ELAINE 
p736
V Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening!   When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got   this scenario right.  
p737
tp738
a(V JERRY 
p739
V Alright Elaine.  
p740
tp741
a(V ELAINE 
p742
V No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind   of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!   
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V It was just a couple of blocks.   (Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter) 
p746
tp747
a(V ELAINE 
p748
V Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!     (George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, Jerry   goes to washroom) 
p749
tp750
a(V GEORGE 
p751
V Hey.  
p752
tp753
a(V ELAINE 
p754
V Oh, did you check you machine?   (George takes glass from cupboard) 
p755
tp756
a(V GEORGE 
p757
V No, why, what's happening?  
p758
tp759
a(V ELAINE 
p760
V Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.   
p761
tp762
a(V GEORGE 
p763
V Yeah, okay.  
p764
tp765
a(V ELAINE 
p766
V And I said I hadn't seen her.  
p767
tp768
a(V GEORGE 
p769
V What?!  
p770
tp771
a(V ELAINE 
p772
V No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was   using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I   said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and   then he did mention your name.  
p773
tp774
a(V GEORGE 
p775
V He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!    
p776
tp777
a(V ELAINE 
p778
V He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.   
p779
tp780
a(V GEORGE 
p781
V What? Why couldn't you think of something?!    
p782
tp783
a(V ELAINE 
p784
V Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!   
p785
tp786
a(V GEORGE 
p787
V You lie! How hard is it to lie?!   (Jerry walks back from washroom) 
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V It's not that hard.   (Elaine points finger at George) 
p791
tp792
a(V ELAINE 
p793
V Well who told you to sleep with her George?!   
p794
tp795
a(V GEORGE 
p796
V It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her   all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!   
p797
tp798
a(V ELAINE 
p799
V Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have   said 'God bless you'!  
p800
tp801
a(V GEORGE 
p802
V Oh don't-   (Jerry raises his arms) 
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?   
p806
tp807
a(V GEORGE 
p808
V She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.   
p809
tp810
a(V JERRY 
p811
V A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what   was the young man's name?  
p812
tp813
a(V ELAINE 
p814
V Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.   (Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador) 
p815
tp816
a(V JERRY 
p817
V Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls   of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might   meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Ray's Pizza!     (Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside her   door) 
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the   damage.  
p821
tp822
a(V BECKY 
p823
V Well, I already got an estimate. It's  $875.   
p824
tp825
a(V JERRY 
p826
V $875?   
p827
tp828
a(V BECKY 
p829
V That's right.  
p830
tp831
a(V JERRY 
p832
V Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then   this person can pay me back.   (Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing) 
p833
tp834
a(V JERRY 
p835
V Um, who do I make it out to?  
p836
tp837
a(V BECKY 
p838
V Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.  
p839
tp840
a(V JERRY 
p841
V So, what are you doing this weekend?     (Jerry hands check to Becky) 
p842
tp843
a(V BECKY 
p844
V You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and   now you want to ask me out on a date?  
p845
tp846
a(V JERRY 
p847
V I didn't do it!  
p848
tp849
a(V BECKY 
p850
V Yeah righ-   (Becky sneezes) 
p851
tp852
a(V JERRY 
p853
V You are soo good lookin'.   (Becky closes door) 
p854
tp855
a(V BECKY 
p856
V Thank you.     (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and   George is looking out window) 
p857
tp858
a(V GEORGE 
p859
V Jerry, let's go! You ready?   (Jerry walks out of bedroom) 
p860
tp861
a(V JERRY 
p862
V You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three   weeks!  
p863
tp864
a(V GEORGE 
p865
V Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the   city.  
p866
tp867
a(V JERRY 
p868
V Alright!   (George put his bag over his shoulder) 
p869
tp870
a(V GEORGE 
p871
V Come on let's get out of here.   (Kramer enters) 
p872
tp873
a(V KRAMER 
p874
V How could you?  
p875
tp876
a(V JERRY 
p877
V What?!  
p878
tp879
a(V KRAMER 
p880
V Man! I never thought you were capable of this!   
p881
tp882
a(V JERRY 
p883
V What did I do?  
p884
tp885
a(V KRAMER 
p886
V I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and   ran.  
p887
tp888
a(V JERRY 
p889
V I-   
p890
tp891
a(V KRAMER 
p892
V I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of   friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the   building.  
p893
tp894
a(V JERRY 
p895
V I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!   
p896
tp897
a(V KRAMER 
p898
V Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?    (Jerry is putting on sweater) 
p899
tp900
a(V JERRY 
p901
V No, never.  
p902
tp903
a(V KRAMER 
p904
V Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a   date with her.  
p905
tp906
a(V JERRY 
p907
V You got a date with Becky Gelke?!  
p908
tp909
a(V KRAMER 
p910
V Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.    
p911
tp912
a(V GEORGE 
p913
V Jerry, can we get out of here?!  
p914
tp915
a(V KRAMER 
p916
V As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had   an excuse to talk to her.  
p917
tp918
a.
