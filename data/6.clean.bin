aVthe pony remark written by larry david & jerry seinfeld my parents live in florida now. they moved there last year. they didn't want to move to floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. you know how it works. they got the leisure police. they pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, let's go pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. drop the snow shovel right there, drop it! i am not much for the family gathering. you know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring. it's so dull. and you start to fantasize. you know, you think, what if i just got up and jumped out that window? what would it be like? just crashed right through the glass you know. come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. no, i'm alright. i was just a little bored, there. no, i'm fine. i came back. i wanted to hear a little about that hummel collection, aunt rose. let's pick it up right there.

aVyou know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. i went to work for harry flemming and i came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.
p45
aa(lp46
Vhelen
p47
aVjerry, look at this sport jacket. is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
p48

p75
aa(lp76
Vjerry
p77
aVif i wind up sitting nest to uncle leo, i am leaving. he's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. i guess it's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.

Vjerry

aVoh, yeah. where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.
p198
aa(lp199
Vleo
p200
aVthat's exactly right. he knows the whole history of the park. for two hours he's talking and answering questions. but you want to know something? whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the parks department, you know who he calls?

aVi don't really eat dessert. i'm dieting.
p225
aa(lp226
Vjerry
p227
aVyeah, i can't eat dessert either. the sugar makes my ankles swell up, and i can't dance.
p228
aa(lp229
Vmanya
p230
aVcan't dance?
p231
aa(lp232
Vhelen
p233
aVhe's kidding, manya.

p240
aa(lp241
Vmanya
p242
aVyeah, yeah
p243
aa(lp244
Vhelen
p245
aVi hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. you know, trotters, like at yonkers.
p246
aa(lp247
Vjerry
p248
aVhorses. they're like big riding dogs.
p249
aa(lp250
Velaine
p251
aVwhat about ponies? what kind of abnormal animal is that? and those kids who had their own ponies
p252
aa(lp253
Vjerry
p254
aVi know, i hated those kids. in fact, i hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
p255
aa(lp256
Vmanya
p257
aVi had a pony.
p258
aa(lp259
Vjerry
p260
aVwell, i didn't really mean a pony, per se.
p261
aa(lp262
Vmanya
p263
aVwhen i was a little girl in poland, we all had ponies. my sister had pony, my cousin had pony, so, what's wrong with that?
p264
aa(lp265
Vjerry
p266
aVnothing. nothing at all. i was just merely expressting
p267
aa(lp268
Vhelen
p269
aVshould we have coffee? who's having coffee?
p270
aa(lp271
Vmanya
p272
aVhe was a beautiful pony! and i loved him.
p273
aa(lp274
Vjerry
p275
aVwell, i'm sure you did. who wouldn't love a pony? who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?
p276
aa(lp277
Vmanya
p278
aVyou! you said so!
p279
aa(lp280
Vjerry
p281
aVno, see, we didn't have ponies. i'm sure at the time in poland, they were very common. they were probably like compact cars
p282
aa(lp283
Vmanya
p284
aVthat's it! i've had enough!
p285
aa(lp286
Visaac
p287
aVhave your coffee, everyone. she's a little upset. it's been an emotional day.
p288
aa(lp289
Vjerry
p290
aVi didn't know she had a pony. how was i to know she had a pony? who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? do you know what the odds are on that? i mean, in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats coming into new york harbor, i never saw one of them sitting on a pony. why would anybody come hre if they had a pony? who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? it doesn't make sense am i wrong?
p291
aa(lp292
Vjerry
p293
aVi'll drive you to the airport.
p294
aa(lp295
Vhelen
p296
aVno, we're taking a cab.
p297
aa(lp298
Vjerry
p299
aVi just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.
p300
aa(lp301
Vhelen
p302
aVdon't be rediculous. it was a misunderstanding.
p303
aa(lp304
Vmorty
p305
aVhey, i agree with him. nobody likes a kid with a pony.
p306
aa(lp307
Vjerry
p308
aVwell, if you ever talk to her, tell her i'm sorry. elaine too. she feels terrible.
p309
aa(lp310
Vhelen
p311
aVyou know, you should give manya a call.
p312
aa(lp313
Vjerry
p314
aVmaybe i will.
p315
aa(lp316
Vkramer
p317

Vkramer

aa(lp391
Vjerry

aVi don't know. he said he'd call back.
p393
aa(lp394
Vmorty
p395
aVyou know what this means, don't you? we lost the supersaver. those tickets are non-refundable.

p414
aa(lp415
Vmorty
p416
aVyou know what the flight back'll cost us?
p417
aa(lp418
Vjerry
p419
aVit was just an innocent comment! i didn't know she had a pony!
p420
aa(lp421
Vmorty
p422
aVmaybe we can get an army transport flight. they got a base in sarasota, i think.
p423
aa(lp424
Vjerry
p425
aVthe whole thing ws taking out of context. it was a joke. that's probably uncle leo.
p426
aa(lp427
Vhelen
p428
aVhello? yes, i know well, it's just one of those things sure, sure, we'll see you then. the funeral's wednesday.

aVtwo o' clock, wednesday. what?
p435
aa(lp436
Vjerry

aVi've got the softball game on wednesday. it's the championship.
p438
aa(lp439
Vhelen

aVjery, no one's forcing you.
p453
aa(lp454
Vjerry
p455
aVi mean, who has a funeral on a wednesday? that's what i want to know. i mean, it's the championship. i'm hitting everything.
p456
aa(lp457
Vhelen
p458
aVi don't have a dress to wear. and you. you don't have anything.
p459
aa(lp460
Vmorty
p461
aVi got a sport jacket.
p462
aa(lp463
Vhelen

aVyou're not wearing that to a funeral.
p465
aa(lp466
Vmorty

aVwhat's wrong with it?

aVit looks ridiculous.
p471
aa(lp472
Vmorty

p474
aa(lp475
Vjerry
p476
aVi don't know what to do.

aa(lp478
Vmorty
p479
aVyou know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? oh boy!
p480
aa(lp481
Vjerry
p482
aVwe don't understand death. and the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. and, uh, i mean, hey, you know. i think if you can't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, i don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. i mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. no is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? i mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.
p483
aa(lp484
Velaine
p485
aVi actually like ponies. i was just trying to make conversation. what time's your game?

Velaine
p497
aVhow long does a funeral take?
p498
aa(lp499
Vjerry
p500
aVdepends on how nice the person was. but you gotta figure, even oswald took forty-five minutes.
p501
aa(lp502
Velaine
p503
aVso you cna't do both?
p504
aa(lp505
Vjerry
p506
aVyou know, if the situation were reversed and manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, i wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. i would understand.
p507
aa(lp508
Velaine
p509
aVhow can you even consider not going?
p510
aa(lp511
Vgeorge
p512
aVyou know, i've been thinking i cannot envision any circumstances in which i'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. how's it gonna happen? i just don't see how it could occur.
p513
aa(lp514
Velaine
p515
aVyou know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how i'm actually going to die someday. me, dead. imagine that.
p516
aa(lp517
Vgeorge
p518
aVthey always make me take stock of my life and how i've pretty much wasted all of it, and how i plan to continue wasting it.
p519
aa(lp520
Vjerry
p521
aVi know, and then you say to yourself, from this moment on, i'm not going to waste any more of it. but then you go, how? what can i do that's not wasting it?
p522
aa(lp523
Velaine
p524
aVis this a waste of time? what should we be doing? can't you hae coffee with people?
p525
aa(lp526
Vgeorge
p527
aVyou know, i can't believe you're even considering not playing. we need you. you're hitting everything.
p528
aa(lp529
Velaine
p530
aVhe has to go. he may have killed her.
p531
aa(lp532
Vjerry
p533
aVme? what about you? you brought up the pony.
p534
aa(lp535
Velaine
p536
aVoh, yeah, but i didn't say i hated anyone who had one.
p537
aa(lp538
Vgeorge
p539
aVwho's going to play left field?
p540
aa(lp541
Vjerry
p542
aVbender.
p543
aa(lp544
Vgeorge
p545
aVbender? he can't play left. he stinks. i just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? i mean, you think dead peole care who's at the funeral? they don't even know they're having a funeral. it's not like she's hanging out in the back going, i can't believe jerry didn't show up.
p546
aa(lp547
