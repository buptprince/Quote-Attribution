V  THE DEAL  Written by Larry David     (Comedy club)    I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.

V What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?

V Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?     
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V He was good in Man From Uncle.   
p11
tp12
a(V ELAINE 
p13
V Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?     
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.    
p17
tp18
a(V ELAINE 
p19
V Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.    
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V No, I don't wanna see the naked people.     
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V Been a while?   
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.    
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.    
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)    
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V What?   
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V What?   
p41
tp42
a(V ELAINE 
p43
V What was that look?   
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V What look?   
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V The look you just gave me.   
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V I gave a look?   
p53
tp54
a(V ELAINE 
p55
V Yes.   
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V What kind of look?   
p59
tp60
a(V ELAINE 
p61
V I know that look.   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Then what was it?   
p65
tp66
a(V ELAINE 
p67
V Why should I tell you?   
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.    
p71
tp72
a(V ELAINE 
p73
V Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...     
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V What?   
p77
tp78
a(V ELAINE 
p79
V What about the look?   
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V I don't know.   
p83
tp84
a(V ELAINE 
p85
V You got something on your mind?   
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V No. Things pop into your head. You?     
p89
tp90
a(V ELAINE 
p91
V Things occur to me from time to time.     
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.     
p95
tp96
a(V ELAINE 
p97
V No, of course not.   
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?    
p101
tp102
a(V ELAINE 
p103
V Thirty-seven.   
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)     
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V We know the terrain.   
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V No big surprises.   
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V Nope.   
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V What do you think?   
p119
tp120
a(V ELAINE 
p121
V I don't know. What do you think?   
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V Well, it's something to consider.   
p125
tp126
a(V ELAINE 
p127
V Yeah.   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V I mean, let's say we did.   
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V What if.   
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V Is that like the end of the world or something?    
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V Certainly not.   
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?    
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V I know.   
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.     
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V It's almost stupid if we didn't.   
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V It's moronic.   
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V Absurd!   
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.    
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V We, there are always a few.   
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.    
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V Devastating.   
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)     
p173
tp174
a(V ELAINE 
p175
V And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)     
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.    
p179
tp180
a(V ELAINE 
p181
V Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.    
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.    
p185
tp186
a(V ELAINE 
p187
V Huh.   
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.    
p191
tp192
a(V ELAINE 
p193
V Right.   
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.    
p197
tp198
a(V ELAINE 
p199
V Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.    
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.   
p203
tp204
a(V ELAINE 
p205
V All right, sir.   
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.     
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!     
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V Well now we're gettin' somewhere.   
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V What about the kiss goodnight?   
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V Tough one. You're call.   
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V It's brug-wa (?).   
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Fine. Well.   
p227
tp228
a(V ELAINE 
p229
V Well.   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V You ready?   
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE 
p235
V Ready.   
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V So think you can handle this?   
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)     
p242
tp243
a(V KRAMER 
p244
V Hey.   
p245
tp246
a(V JERRY 
p247
V Hey.   
p248
tp249
a(V KRAMER 
p250
V Got the paper?   
p251
tp252
a(V JERRY 
p253
V Not yet.   
p254
tp255
a(V KRAMER 
p256
V No paper?   
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V I haven't been out yet.   
p260
tp261
a(V KRAMER 
p262
V Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)      
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?    
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?     
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?    
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.    
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.    
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V I thought you'd like that.   
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V Oh, this is huge!   
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V I know.   
p287
tp288
a(V GEORGE 
p289
V All right, okay. Let's go, details.     
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V No, I can't do details.   
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V You wha?   
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V I can't give details.   
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V No details?   
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V I'm not in the mood.   
p305
tp306
a(V GEORGE 
p307
V You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!     
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.    
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V Where are you sitting?   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V On the couch.   
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V Next to each other?   
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V No, separated.   
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V Time?   
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V About eleven.   
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V Okay, go ahead.   
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.    
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.    
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.    
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V Boy, these are really bad details.     
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.    
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.    
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.    
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V Better than before?   
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.    
p359
tp360
a(V GEORGE 
p361
V This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?    
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V Not exactly.   
p365
tp366
a(V GEORGE 
p367
V Not exactly. What does that mean?   
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)    
p371
tp372
a(V GEORGE 
p373
V Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.   (He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.    
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V I think we've worked out a system.     
p377
tp378
a(V GEORGE 
p379
V Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.    
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.    
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.     
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Okay. No calls the next day.   
p389
tp390
a(V GEORGE 
p391
V (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.     
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V You ready for the second one?   
p395
tp396
a(V GEORGE 
p397
V I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.    
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Spending the night. Optional.   
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V No, you see? You got greedy.   
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V No, that's the rule. It's optional.     
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.    
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V I think you're wrong.   
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V I hope I am.     
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Is this yours or the roommate's?   
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V The roommate's.   
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V Would she mind?   
p425
tp426
a(V ELAINE 
p427
V She keeps track of everything.   
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.    
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Thanks.   
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V Well, guess I'll get going.   
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V Oh.   
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.     
p443
tp444
a(V ELAINE 
p445
V Fine, go away.   
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.     
p449
tp450
a(V ELAINE 
p451
V Just go.   
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V I'm having surgery tomorrow.   
p455
tp456
a(V ELAINE 
p457
V Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.     
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V But you said, it can be very serious.     
p461
tp462
a(V ELAINE 
p463
V Okay, so fine. Go.   
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.    
p467
tp468
a(V ELAINE 
p469
V Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.     
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V It has nothing to do with whose house it is.    
p473
tp474
a(V ELAINE 
p475
V Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)    
p476
tp477
a(V TINA 
p478
V Hi.    ELAINE + JERRY  Hi.   
p479
tp480
a(V TINA 
p481
V Hi, Jerry.   
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V Hi.   
p485
tp486
a(V TINA 
p487
V Such a great improv class tonight.     
p488
tp489
a(V ELAINE 
p490
V Oh really?   
p491
tp492
a(V TINA 
p493
V I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.     
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?    
p497
tp498
a(V TINA 
p499
V Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)    
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V What are you doing?   
p503
tp504
a(V JERRY 
p505
V I can't go if you're mad.   
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V I'm not mad.   
p509
tp510
a(V JERRY 
p511
V You seemed a little mad.   
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.    
p515
tp516
a(V JERRY 
p517
V So you're okay with everything?   
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Definitely. Are you?   
p521
tp522
a(V JERRY 
p523
V Definitely. Well, goodnight.   
p524
tp525
a(V ELAINE 
p526
V Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?    
p527
tp528
a(V JERRY 
p529
V What?   
p530
tp531
a(V ELAINE 
p532
V Rules.   
p533
tp534
a(V TINA 
p535
V Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)      
p536

a(V GEORGE 
p538
V What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.    
p539
tp540
a(V JERRY 
p541
V No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.     
p542
tp543
a(V GEORGE 
p544
V Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.   
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.    
p548
tp549
a(V GEORGE 
p550
V What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?     
p551
tp552
a(V JERRY 
p553
V You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.    
p554
tp555
a(V GEORGE 
p556
V What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.    
p557
tp558
a(V JERRY 
p559
V I think I heard her say something about a bench.    
p560
tp561
a(V GEORGE 
p562
V A bench? What kind of a bench?   
p563
tp564
a(V JERRY 
p565
V I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.     
p566
tp567
a(V GEORGE 
p568
V What, like at a bus stop?   
p569
tp570
a(V JERRY 
p571
V I don't know.   
p572
tp573
a(V GEORGE 
p574
V Like a park bench?   
p575
tp576
a(V JERRY 
p577
V I have no idea.   
p578
tp579
a(V GEORGE 
p580
V Who puts a bench in their house?   
p581
tp582
a(V JERRY 
p583
V Forget the bench.   
p584
tp585
a(V GEORGE 
p586
V I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?    
p587
tp588
a(V JERRY 
p589
V No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.    
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.    
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V Nice looking fellow.   
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V What about candle holders?   
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V Too romantic.   
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V Lingerie?   
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V Too sexual.   
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V Waffle maker.   
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V Too domestic.   
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.   
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V Too Gubernatorial. (?)   
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V Let's work on the card.     
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V Maybe you won't like it.   
p626
tp627
a(V ELAINE 
p628
V Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.    
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V You could not like it.   
p632
tp633
a(V ELAINE 
p634
V Just the fact that you remembered means everything.    
p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)    
p638
tp639
a(V ELAINE 
p640
V Cash?   
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V Would do you think?   
p644
tp645
a(V ELAINE 
p646
V You got me cash?   
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?    
p650
tp651
a(V ELAINE 
p652
V Who are you, my uncle?   
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.    
p656
tp657
a(V ELAINE 
p658
V Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)    
p659
tp660
a(V KRAMER 
p661
V Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)    
p662
tp663
a(V ELAINE 
p664
V Pal? You think I'm your pal?   
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V I said, "and more."   
p668
tp669
a(V ELAINE 
p670
V I am not your pal.   
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)    
p674
tp675
a(V ELAINE 
p676
V Oh, what is this? You got me something?     
p677
tp678
a(V KRAMER 
p679
V Yeah. Open it.   
p680
tp681
a(V ELAINE 
p682
V Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)    
p683
tp684
a(V KRAMER 
p685
V That's pretty good, huh?   
p686
tp687
a(V JERRY 
p688
V Great.   
p689
tp690
a(V KRAMER 
p691
V Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.    
p692
tp693
a(V JERRY 
p694
V Well goody for you.   
p695
tp696
a(V KRAMER 
p697
V Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?    
p698
tp699
a(V JERRY 
p700
V 182 bucks.   
p701
tp702
a(V KRAMER 
p703
V Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.    
p704
tp705
a(V ELAINE 
p706
V (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.    
p707
tp708
a(V KRAMER 
p709
V (To Jerry) Yates.   
p710
tp711
a(V ELAINE 
p712
V Oh Kramer. (They embrace)   
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V Could you excuse us please?   
p716
tp717
a(V KRAMER 
p718
V What?   
p719
tp720
a(V JERRY 
p721
V We're talking.   
p722
tp723
a(V KRAMER 
p724
V Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)   
p725
tp726
a(V JERRY 
p727
V You know, we never had one fight before this deal.    
p728
tp729
a(V ELAINE 
p730
V I know.   
p731
tp732
a(V JERRY 
p733
V Never.   
p734
tp735
a(V ELAINE 
p736
V Ever.   
p737
tp738
a(V JERRY 
p739
V We got along beautifully.   
p740
tp741
a(V ELAINE 
p742
V Like clams.   
p743
tp744
a(V JERRY 
p745
V It was wonderful.   
p746
tp747
a(V ELAINE 
p748
V A pleasure.   
p749
tp750
a(V JERRY 
p751
V So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.     
p752
tp753
a(V ELAINE 
p754
V I can't do it.   
p755
tp756
a(V JERRY 
p757
V You what?   
p758
tp759
a(V ELAINE 
p760
V I can't do that.   
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?    
p764
tp765
a(V ELAINE 
p766
V This, that, and the other.   
p767
tp768
a(V JERRY 
p769
V Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?    
p770
tp771
a(V ELAINE 
p772
V You.   
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...       
p776
tp777
a(V GEORGE 
p778
V Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.     
p779
tp780
a(V JERRY 
p781
V I never should have made up those rules.     
p782
tp783
a(V GEORGE 
p784
V What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?    
p785
tp786
a(V JERRY 
p787
V It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.     
p788
tp789
a(V GEORGE 
p790
V You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.    
p791
tp792
a(V JERRY 
p793
V Why?   
p794
tp795
a(V GEORGE 
p796
V It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.    
p797
tp798
a(V JERRY 
p799
V What did you end up giving her?   
p800
tp801
a(V GEORGE 
p802
V 91 dollars.   
p803
tp804
a(V JERRY 
p805
V Sorry about that.   
p806
tp807
a(V GEORGE 
p808
V So what're you gonna do?   
p809
tp810
a(V JERRY 
p811
V Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.    
p812
tp813
a(V GEORGE 
p814
V So, maybe this should be it.   
p815
tp816
a(V JERRY 
p817
V Could be it.   
p818
tp819
a(V GEORGE 
p820
V She seems like an it.   
p821
tp822
a(V JERRY 
p823
V She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...     
p824
tp825
a(V GEORGE 
p826
V We'd have to kill him.   
p827
tp828
a(V JERRY 
p829
V We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.     
p830
tp831
a(V GEORGE 
p832
V I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.    
p833
tp834
a(V JERRY 
p835
V Plus, you know what else.   
p836
tp837
a(V GEORGE 
p838
V You better call her.     
p839
tp840
a(V KRAMER 
p841
V Hey.   
p842
tp843
a(V JERRY 
p844
V Hey.   
p845
tp846
a(V KRAMER 
p847
V You got the paper yet?   
p848
tp849
a(V JERRY 
p850
V Yeah.   
p851
tp852
a(V KRAMER 
p853
V Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?    
p854
tp855
a(V ELAINE 
p856
V No.   
p857
tp858
a(V KRAMER 
p859
V Well, you're not reading it now.   
p860
tp861
a(V ELAINE 
p862
V All right, you can take it. But I want it back.    
p863
tp864
a(V KRAMER 
p865
V Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?    
p866
tp867
a(V ELAINE 
p868
V Ah, this. And that.   
p869
tp870
a(V JERRY 
p871
V And the other.   
p872
tp873
a.
