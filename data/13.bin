aV  THE DEAL  Written by Larry David     (Comedy club)    I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.

p5
aV What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?    
p6
aa(lp7
V ELAINE 
p8
aV Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?     
p9
aa(lp10
V JERRY 
p11
aV He was good in Man From Uncle.   
p12
aa(lp13
V ELAINE 
p14
aV Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?     
p15
aa(lp16
V JERRY 
p17
aV I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.    
p18
aa(lp19
V ELAINE 
p20
aV Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.    
p21
aa(lp22
V JERRY 
p23
aV No, I don't wanna see the naked people.     
p24
aa(lp25
V ELAINE 
p26
aV Been a while?   
p27
aa(lp28
V JERRY 
p29
aV I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.    
p30
aa(lp31
V ELAINE 
p32
aV I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.    
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY 
p35
aV I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)    
p36
aa(lp37
V ELAINE 
p38
aV What?   
p39
aa(lp40
V JERRY 
p41
aV What?   
p42
aa(lp43
V ELAINE 
p44
aV What was that look?   
p45
aa(lp46
V JERRY 
p47
aV What look?   
p48
aa(lp49
V ELAINE 
p50
aV The look you just gave me.   
p51
aa(lp52
V JERRY 
p53
aV I gave a look?   
p54
aa(lp55
V ELAINE 
p56
aV Yes.   
p57
aa(lp58
V JERRY 
p59
aV What kind of look?   
p60
aa(lp61
V ELAINE 
p62
aV I know that look.   
p63
aa(lp64
V JERRY 
p65
aV Then what was it?   
p66
aa(lp67
V ELAINE 
p68
aV Why should I tell you?   
p69
aa(lp70
V JERRY 
p71
aV Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.    
p72
aa(lp73
V ELAINE 
p74
aV Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...     
p75
aa(lp76
V JERRY 
p77
aV What?   
p78
aa(lp79
V ELAINE 
p80
aV What about the look?   
p81
aa(lp82
V JERRY 
p83
aV I don't know.   
p84
aa(lp85
V ELAINE 
p86
aV You got something on your mind?   
p87
aa(lp88
V JERRY 
p89
aV No. Things pop into your head. You?     
p90
aa(lp91
V ELAINE 
p92
aV Things occur to me from time to time.     
p93
aa(lp94
V JERRY 
p95
aV Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.     
p96
aa(lp97
V ELAINE 
p98
aV No, of course not.   
p99
aa(lp100
V JERRY 
p101
aV I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?    
p102
aa(lp103
V ELAINE 
p104
aV Thirty-seven.   
p105
aa(lp106
V JERRY 
p107
aV Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)     
p108
aa(lp109
V ELAINE 
p110
aV We know the terrain.   
p111
aa(lp112
V JERRY 
p113
aV No big surprises.   
p114
aa(lp115
V ELAINE 
p116
aV Nope.   
p117
aa(lp118
V JERRY 
p119
aV What do you think?   
p120
aa(lp121
V ELAINE 
p122
aV I don't know. What do you think?   
p123
aa(lp124
V JERRY 
p125
aV Well, it's something to consider.   
p126
aa(lp127
V ELAINE 
p128
aV Yeah.   
p129
aa(lp130
V JERRY 
p131
aV I mean, let's say we did.   
p132
aa(lp133
V ELAINE 
p134
aV What if.   
p135
aa(lp136
V JERRY 
p137
aV Is that like the end of the world or something?    
p138
aa(lp139
V ELAINE 
p140
aV Certainly not.   
p141
aa(lp142
V JERRY 
p143
aV Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?    
p144
aa(lp145
V ELAINE 
p146
aV I know.   
p147
aa(lp148
V JERRY 
p149
aV I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.     
p150
aa(lp151
V ELAINE 
p152
aV It's almost stupid if we didn't.   
p153
aa(lp154
V JERRY 
p155
aV It's moronic.   
p156
aa(lp157
V ELAINE 
p158
aV Absurd!   
p159
aa(lp160
V JERRY 
p161
aV Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.    
p162
aa(lp163
V ELAINE 
p164
aV We, there are always a few.   
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.    
p168
aa(lp169
V ELAINE 
p170
aV Devastating.   
p171
aa(lp172
V JERRY 
p173
aV Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)     
p174
aa(lp175
V ELAINE 
p176
aV And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)     
p177
aa(lp178
V JERRY 
p179
aV That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.    
p180
aa(lp181
V ELAINE 
p182
aV Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.    
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.    
p186
aa(lp187
V ELAINE 
p188
aV Huh.   
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.    
p192
aa(lp193
V ELAINE 
p194
aV Right.   
p195
aa(lp196
V JERRY 
p197
aV But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.    
p198
aa(lp199
V ELAINE 
p200
aV Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.    
p201
aa(lp202
V JERRY 
p203
aV Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.   
p204
aa(lp205
V ELAINE 
p206
aV All right, sir.   
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.     
p210
aa(lp211
V ELAINE 
p212
aV Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!     
p213
aa(lp214
V JERRY 
p215
aV Well now we're gettin' somewhere.   
p216
aa(lp217
V ELAINE 
p218
aV What about the kiss goodnight?   
p219
aa(lp220
V JERRY 
p221
aV Tough one. You're call.   
p222
aa(lp223
V ELAINE 
p224
aV It's brug-wa (?).   
p225
aa(lp226
V JERRY 
p227
aV Fine. Well.   
p228
aa(lp229
V ELAINE 
p230
aV Well.   
p231
aa(lp232
V JERRY 
p233
aV You ready?   
p234
aa(lp235
V ELAINE 
p236
aV Ready.   
p237
aa(lp238
V JERRY 
p239
aV So think you can handle this?   
p240
aa(lp241
V ELAINE 
p242
aV Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)     
p243
aa(lp244
V KRAMER 
p245
aV Hey.   
p246
aa(lp247
V JERRY 
p248
aV Hey.   
p249
aa(lp250
V KRAMER 
p251
aV Got the paper?   
p252
aa(lp253
V JERRY 
p254
aV Not yet.   
p255
aa(lp256
V KRAMER 
p257
aV No paper?   
p258
aa(lp259
V JERRY 
p260
aV I haven't been out yet.   
p261
aa(lp262
V KRAMER 
p263
aV Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)      
p264
aa(lp265
V GEORGE 
p266
aV What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?    
p267
aa(lp268
V JERRY 
p269
aV No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?     
p270
aa(lp271
V GEORGE 
p272
aV Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?    
p273
aa(lp274
V JERRY 
p275
aV Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.    
p276
aa(lp277
V GEORGE 
p278
aV Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.    
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV I thought you'd like that.   
p282
aa(lp283
V GEORGE 
p284
aV Oh, this is huge!   
p285
aa(lp286
V JERRY 
p287
aV I know.   
p288
aa(lp289
V GEORGE 
p290
aV All right, okay. Let's go, details.     
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV No, I can't do details.   
p294
aa(lp295
V GEORGE 
p296
aV You wha?   
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV I can't give details.   
p300
aa(lp301
V GEORGE 
p302
aV No details?   
p303
aa(lp304
V JERRY 
p305
aV I'm not in the mood.   
p306
aa(lp307
V GEORGE 
p308
aV You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!     
p309
aa(lp310
V JERRY 
p311
aV All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.    
p312
aa(lp313
V GEORGE 
p314
aV Where are you sitting?   
p315
aa(lp316
V JERRY 
p317
aV On the couch.   
p318
aa(lp319
V GEORGE 
p320
aV Next to each other?   
p321
aa(lp322
V JERRY 
p323
aV No, separated.   
p324
aa(lp325
V GEORGE 
p326
aV Time?   
p327
aa(lp328
V JERRY 
p329
aV About eleven.   
p330
aa(lp331
V GEORGE 
p332
aV Okay, go ahead.   
p333
aa(lp334
V JERRY 
p335
aV So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.    
p336
aa(lp337
V GEORGE 
p338
aV Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.    
p339
aa(lp340
V JERRY 
p341
aV And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.    
p342
aa(lp343
V GEORGE 
p344
aV Boy, these are really bad details.     
p345
aa(lp346
V JERRY 
p347
aV It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.    
p348
aa(lp349
V GEORGE 
p350
aV Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.    
p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY 
p353
aV Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.    
p354
aa(lp355
V GEORGE 
p356
aV Better than before?   
p357
aa(lp358
V JERRY 
p359
aV She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.    
p360
aa(lp361
V GEORGE 
p362
aV This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?    
p363
aa(lp364
V JERRY 
p365
aV Not exactly.   
p366
aa(lp367
V GEORGE 
p368
aV Not exactly. What does that mean?   
p369
aa(lp370
V JERRY 
p371
aV Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)    
p372
aa(lp373
V GEORGE 
p374
aV Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.   (He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.    
p375
aa(lp376
V JERRY 
p377
aV I think we've worked out a system.     
p378
aa(lp379
V GEORGE 
p380
aV Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.    
p381
aa(lp382
V JERRY 
p383
aV No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.    
p384
aa(lp385
V GEORGE 
p386
aV Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.     
p387
aa(lp388
V JERRY 
p389
aV Okay. No calls the next day.   
p390
aa(lp391
V GEORGE 
p392
aV (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.     
p393
aa(lp394
V JERRY 
p395
aV You ready for the second one?   
p396
aa(lp397
V GEORGE 
p398
aV I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.    
p399
aa(lp400
V JERRY 
p401
aV Spending the night. Optional.   
p402
aa(lp403
V GEORGE 
p404
aV No, you see? You got greedy.   
p405
aa(lp406
V JERRY 
p407
aV No, that's the rule. It's optional.     
p408
aa(lp409
V GEORGE 
p410
aV I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.    
p411
aa(lp412
V JERRY 
p413
aV I think you're wrong.   
p414
aa(lp415
V GEORGE 
p416
aV I hope I am.     
p417
aa(lp418
V JERRY 
p419
aV Is this yours or the roommate's?   
p420
aa(lp421
V ELAINE 
p422
aV The roommate's.   
p423
aa(lp424
V JERRY 
p425
aV Would she mind?   
p426
aa(lp427
V ELAINE 
p428
aV She keeps track of everything.   
p429
aa(lp430
V JERRY 
p431
aV Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.    
p432
aa(lp433
V ELAINE 
p434
aV Thanks.   
p435
aa(lp436
V JERRY 
p437
aV Well, guess I'll get going.   
p438
aa(lp439
V ELAINE 
p440
aV Oh.   
p441
aa(lp442
V JERRY 
p443
aV Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.     
p444
aa(lp445
V ELAINE 
p446
aV Fine, go away.   
p447
aa(lp448
V JERRY 
p449
aV I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.     
p450
aa(lp451
V ELAINE 
p452
aV Just go.   
p453
aa(lp454
V JERRY 
p455
aV I'm having surgery tomorrow.   
p456
aa(lp457
V ELAINE 
p458
aV Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.     
p459
aa(lp460
V JERRY 
p461
aV But you said, it can be very serious.     
p462
aa(lp463
V ELAINE 
p464
aV Okay, so fine. Go.   
p465
aa(lp466
V JERRY 
p467
aV What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.    
p468
aa(lp469
V ELAINE 
p470
aV Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.     
p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV It has nothing to do with whose house it is.    
p474
aa(lp475
V ELAINE 
p476
aV Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)    
p477
aa(lp478
V TINA 
p479
aV Hi.    ELAINE + JERRY  Hi.   
p480
aa(lp481
V TINA 
p482
aV Hi, Jerry.   
p483
aa(lp484
V JERRY 
p485
aV Hi.   
p486
aa(lp487
V TINA 
p488
aV Such a great improv class tonight.     
p489
aa(lp490
V ELAINE 
p491
aV Oh really?   
p492
aa(lp493
V TINA 
p494
aV I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.     
p495
aa(lp496
V ELAINE 
p497
aV Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?    
p498
aa(lp499
V TINA 
p500
aV Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)    
p501
aa(lp502
V ELAINE 
p503
aV What are you doing?   
p504
aa(lp505
V JERRY 
p506
aV I can't go if you're mad.   
p507
aa(lp508
V ELAINE 
p509
aV I'm not mad.   
p510
aa(lp511
V JERRY 
p512
aV You seemed a little mad.   
p513
aa(lp514
V ELAINE 
p515
aV No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.    
p516
aa(lp517
V JERRY 
p518
aV So you're okay with everything?   
p519
aa(lp520
V ELAINE 
p521
aV Definitely. Are you?   
p522
aa(lp523
V JERRY 
p524
aV Definitely. Well, goodnight.   
p525
aa(lp526
V ELAINE 
p527
aV Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?    
p528
aa(lp529
V JERRY 
p530
aV What?   
p531
aa(lp532
V ELAINE 
p533
aV Rules.   
p534
aa(lp535
V TINA 
p536
aV Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)      
p537
aa(lp538
V GEORGE 
p539
aV What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.    
p540
aa(lp541
V JERRY 
p542
aV No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.     
p543
aa(lp544
V GEORGE 
p545
aV Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.   
p546
aa(lp547
V JERRY 
p548
aV No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.    
p549
aa(lp550
V GEORGE 
p551
aV What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?     
p552
aa(lp553
V JERRY 
p554
aV You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.    
p555
aa(lp556
V GEORGE 
p557
aV What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.    
p558
aa(lp559
V JERRY 
p560
aV I think I heard her say something about a bench.    
p561
aa(lp562
V GEORGE 
p563
aV A bench? What kind of a bench?   
p564
aa(lp565
V JERRY 
p566
aV I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.     
p567
aa(lp568
V GEORGE 
p569
aV What, like at a bus stop?   
p570
aa(lp571
V JERRY 
p572
aV I don't know.   
p573
aa(lp574
V GEORGE 
p575
aV Like a park bench?   
p576
aa(lp577
V JERRY 
p578
aV I have no idea.   
p579
aa(lp580
V GEORGE 
p581
aV Who puts a bench in their house?   
p582
aa(lp583
V JERRY 
p584
aV Forget the bench.   
p585
aa(lp586
V GEORGE 
p587
aV I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?    
p588
aa(lp589
V JERRY 
p590
aV No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.    
p591
aa(lp592
V GEORGE 
p593
aV Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.    
p594
aa(lp595
V JERRY 
p596
aV Nice looking fellow.   
p597
aa(lp598
V GEORGE 
p599
aV What about candle holders?   
p600
aa(lp601
V JERRY 
p602
aV Too romantic.   
p603
aa(lp604
V GEORGE 
p605
aV Lingerie?   
p606
aa(lp607
V JERRY 
p608
aV Too sexual.   
p609
aa(lp610
V GEORGE 
p611
aV Waffle maker.   
p612
aa(lp613
V JERRY 
p614
aV Too domestic.   
p615
aa(lp616
V GEORGE 
p617
aV Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.   
p618
aa(lp619
V JERRY 
p620
aV Too Gubernatorial. (?)   
p621
aa(lp622
V GEORGE 
p623
aV Let's work on the card.     
p624
aa(lp625
V JERRY 
p626
aV Maybe you won't like it.   
p627
aa(lp628
V ELAINE 
p629
aV Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.    
p630
aa(lp631
V JERRY 
p632
aV You could not like it.   
p633
aa(lp634
V ELAINE 
p635
aV Just the fact that you remembered means everything.    
p636
aa(lp637
V JERRY 
p638
aV Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)    
p639
aa(lp640
V ELAINE 
p641
aV Cash?   
p642
aa(lp643
V JERRY 
p644
aV Would do you think?   
p645
aa(lp646
V ELAINE 
p647
aV You got me cash?   
p648
aa(lp649
V JERRY 
p650
aV Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?    
p651
aa(lp652
V ELAINE 
p653
aV Who are you, my uncle?   
p654
aa(lp655
V JERRY 
p656
aV Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.    
p657
aa(lp658
V ELAINE 
p659
aV Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)    
p660
aa(lp661
V KRAMER 
p662
aV Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)    
p663
aa(lp664
V ELAINE 
p665
aV Pal? You think I'm your pal?   
p666
aa(lp667
V JERRY 
p668
aV I said, "and more."   
p669
aa(lp670
V ELAINE 
p671
aV I am not your pal.   
p672
aa(lp673
V JERRY 
p674
aV What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)    
p675
aa(lp676
V ELAINE 
p677
aV Oh, what is this? You got me something?     
p678
aa(lp679
V KRAMER 
p680
aV Yeah. Open it.   
p681
aa(lp682
V ELAINE 
p683
aV Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)    
p684
aa(lp685
V KRAMER 
p686
aV That's pretty good, huh?   
p687
aa(lp688
V JERRY 
p689
aV Great.   
p690
aa(lp691
V KRAMER 
p692
aV Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.    
p693
aa(lp694
V JERRY 
p695
aV Well goody for you.   
p696
aa(lp697
V KRAMER 
p698
aV Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?    
p699
aa(lp700
V JERRY 
p701
aV 182 bucks.   
p702
aa(lp703
V KRAMER 
p704
aV Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.    
p705
aa(lp706
V ELAINE 
p707
aV (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.    
p708
aa(lp709
V KRAMER 
p710
aV (To Jerry) Yates.   
p711
aa(lp712
V ELAINE 
p713
aV Oh Kramer. (They embrace)   
p714
aa(lp715
V JERRY 
p716
aV Could you excuse us please?   
p717
aa(lp718
V KRAMER 
p719
aV What?   
p720
aa(lp721
V JERRY 
p722
aV We're talking.   
p723
aa(lp724
V KRAMER 
p725
aV Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)   
p726
aa(lp727
V JERRY 
p728
aV You know, we never had one fight before this deal.    
p729
aa(lp730
V ELAINE 
p731
aV I know.   
p732
aa(lp733
V JERRY 
p734
aV Never.   
p735
aa(lp736
V ELAINE 
p737
aV Ever.   
p738
aa(lp739
V JERRY 
p740
aV We got along beautifully.   
p741
aa(lp742
V ELAINE 
p743
aV Like clams.   
p744
aa(lp745
V JERRY 
p746
aV It was wonderful.   
p747
aa(lp748
V ELAINE 
p749
aV A pleasure.   
p750
aa(lp751
V JERRY 
p752
aV So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.     
p753
aa(lp754
V ELAINE 
p755
aV I can't do it.   
p756
aa(lp757
V JERRY 
p758
aV You what?   
p759
aa(lp760
V ELAINE 
p761
aV I can't do that.   
p762
aa(lp763
V JERRY 
p764
aV You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?    
p765
aa(lp766
V ELAINE 
p767
aV This, that, and the other.   
p768
aa(lp769
V JERRY 
p770
aV Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?    
p771
aa(lp772
V ELAINE 
p773
aV You.   
p774
aa(lp775
V JERRY 
p776
aV (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...       
p777
aa(lp778
V GEORGE 
p779
aV Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.     
p780
aa(lp781
V JERRY 
p782
aV I never should have made up those rules.     
p783
aa(lp784
V GEORGE 
p785
aV What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?    
p786
aa(lp787
V JERRY 
p788
aV It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.     
p789
aa(lp790
V GEORGE 
p791
aV You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.    
p792
aa(lp793
V JERRY 
p794
aV Why?   
p795
aa(lp796
V GEORGE 
p797
aV It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.    
p798
aa(lp799
V JERRY 
p800
aV What did you end up giving her?   
p801
aa(lp802
V GEORGE 
p803
aV 91 dollars.   
p804
aa(lp805
V JERRY 
p806
aV Sorry about that.   
p807
aa(lp808
V GEORGE 
p809
aV So what're you gonna do?   
p810
aa(lp811
V JERRY 
p812
aV Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.    
p813
aa(lp814
V GEORGE 
p815
aV So, maybe this should be it.   
p816
aa(lp817
V JERRY 
p818
aV Could be it.   
p819
aa(lp820
V GEORGE 
p821
aV She seems like an it.   
p822
aa(lp823
V JERRY 
p824
aV She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...     
p825
aa(lp826
V GEORGE 
p827
aV We'd have to kill him.   
p828
aa(lp829
V JERRY 
p830
aV We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.     
p831
aa(lp832
V GEORGE 
p833
aV I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.    
p834
aa(lp835
V JERRY 
p836
aV Plus, you know what else.   
p837
aa(lp838
V GEORGE 
p839
aV You better call her.     
p840
aa(lp841
V KRAMER 
p842
aV Hey.   
p843
aa(lp844
V JERRY 
p845
aV Hey.   
p846
aa(lp847
V KRAMER 
p848
aV You got the paper yet?   
p849
aa(lp850
V JERRY 
p851
aV Yeah.   
p852
aa(lp853
V KRAMER 
p854
aV Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?    
p855
aa(lp856
V ELAINE 
p857
aV No.   
p858
aa(lp859
V KRAMER 
p860
aV Well, you're not reading it now.   
p861
aa(lp862
V ELAINE 
p863
aV All right, you can take it. But I want it back.    
p864
aa(lp865
V KRAMER 
p866
aV Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?    
p867
aa(lp868
V ELAINE 
p869
aV Ah, this. And that.   
p870
aa(lp871
V JERRY 
p872
aV And the other.   
p873
aa.
