V Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the    convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be   real difficult getting it down the stairs.

V Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was    walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty   boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned   around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. ...   Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream   out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
