V  THE BABY SHOWER  Written by Larry Charles     (Night club)   Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching.     You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it    was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the    show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before    there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their    entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story,    what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next    guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of    here. I'm going to bed."

V (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.    
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V She's the performance artist, right?    
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.    
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?   
p14
tp15
a(V ELAINE 
p16
V Todd.  
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.    
p20
tp21
a(V ELAINE 
p22
V No, he's not.  
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.    
p26
tp27
a(V ELAINE 
p28
V By marriage.  
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on    bad directions.  
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.   
p35
tp36
a(V ELAINE 
p37
V Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.    
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?   
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V Thin ice, George. Thin ice..  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.    
p47
tp48
a(V ELAINE 
p49
V She stopped performing.  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.   
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.    
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".   
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?   
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red     shirt.  
p65
tp66
a(V ELAINE 
p67
V It was an accident!  
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all    over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a    groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"   
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.   
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I     was dirt.  
p77
tp78
a(V JERRY 
p79
V What ever happened with the shirt?    
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.   
p83
tp84
a(V ELAINE 
p85
V I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.    
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?   
p89
tp90
a(V ELAINE 
p91
V anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.    
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.    
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.   
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.  
p101
tp102
a(V ELAINE 
p103
V Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's    all so boring..  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!   
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.   
p110
tp111
a(V GEORGE 
p112
V Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.   
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..   
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V But?  
p119
tp120
a(V ELAINE 
p121
V My roommate has Lyme disease.  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?   
p125
tp126
a(V ELAINE 
p127
V She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V How did she get Lyme disease?  
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.   
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V They still do that play?  
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V It's a classic.  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V With all the nudity?  
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.   
p146
tp147
a(V GEORGE 
p148
V (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!   
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.   
p152
tp153
a(V ELAINE 
p154
V What do you wanna know?  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?   
p158
tp159
a(V ELAINE 
p160
V Rarely.  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?   
p164
tp165
a(V ELAINE 
p166
V No.  
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V When is this suppose to be?  
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V Saturday.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?    
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.   
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off    the table.  
p182
tp183
a(V GEORGE 
p184
V Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.   
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V And if you do?  
p188
tp189
a(V GEORGE 
p190
V I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.     (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)   
p191
tp192
a(V KRAMER 
p193
V What are you doing this for? Look at you..   
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.    
p197
tp198
a(V KRAMER 
p199
V But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.   
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V (Pleading) Leave me alone.  
p203
tp204
a(V KRAMER 
p205
V It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!   
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V I'm not getting illegal cable!  
p209
tp210
a(V KRAMER 
p211
V Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V No, I read in the paper..  
p215
tp216
a(V KRAMER 
p217
V (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..  
p218
tp219
a(V JERRY 
p220
V Well, they might hook us up again.    
p221
tp222
a(V KRAMER 
p223
V Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things..    Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!    
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.    
p227
tp228
a(V KRAMER 
p229
V Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!   
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V What you're suggesting is illegal.    
p233
tp234
a(V KRAMER 
p235
V It's not illegal.  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V It's against the law.  
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V Well, yeah.  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?    
p245
tp246
a(V KRAMER 
p247
V (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's     like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.   
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V A real human rights nut, huh?  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V Yeah. He's intense, man.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V I don't know. What if I get caught?    
p257
tp258
a(V KRAMER 
p259
V Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.    (Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles,    shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks confused)   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.   
p263
tp264
a(V TABACHNICK 
p265
V Tomarrow okay.  
p266
tp267
a(V KRAMER 
p268
V No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.   
p269
tp270
a(V JERRY 
p271
V (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..   
p272
tp273
a(V KRAMER 
p274
V No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..    
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.   
p278
tp279
a(V KRAMER 
p280
V You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's     gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Jerry enters carrying luggage. A group of nem in suits are waiting for him)   
p281
tp282
a(V MAN 
p283
V Mr. Steinfeld?  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V Seinfeld.  
p287
tp288
a(V MAN 
p289
V We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?   
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V My cable hook-up? What about it?  
p293
tp294
a(V MAN 
p295
V It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.    
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?    (An agent leads Kramer out of the bedroom into the living room)    
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.   
p302
tp303
a(V MAN 
p304
V You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.    
p305
tp306
a(V JERRY 
p307
V Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian     guy is the guy you want.   (Tabachnick steps out of the bedroom. He's dressed like the other FBI men, and speaks without an accent now)   
p308
tp309
a(V TABACHNICK 
p310
V Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.     (Jerry looks around for an excape, then makes a mad dash for the door)   
p311
tp312
a(V KRAMER 
p313
V No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his     hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..    (Scene ends)   (Airplane)   (Jerry shudders when looking back on his dream. A stewardess approaches)   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?    
p317
tp318
a(V STEWARDESS 
p319
V I'm afraid not.  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?   
p323
tp324
a(V STEWARDESS 
p325
V No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.   
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?    (The passenger, Bill, next to him offers his hand)  
p329
tp330
a(V BILL 
p331
V My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.    (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human    beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I    don't belong here."   (Scene ends)   (George's car)   (George is driving while wearing an unzipped coat, and a sweater with a bright red collar under it. Jerry's riding shotgun)    
p335
tp336
a(V GEORGE 
p337
V Sounds like a rough trip.  
p338
tp339
a(V JERRY 
p340
V Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.    
p341
tp342
a(V GEORGE 
p343
V So, the college cancelled the gig?    
p344
tp345
a(V JERRY 
p346
V Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.    
p347
tp348
a(V GEORGE 
p349
V (Modestly) Forget it.  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V No, really.. an airport run.  
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V It's nothing.  
p356
tp357
a(V JERRY 
p358
V Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything -    yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.    
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.    
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.    
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.   
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?   
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.    
p377
tp378
a(V JERRY 
p379
V You want to get a bite?  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.   
p383
tp384
a(V JERRY 
p385
V Well, so what should we do?  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?    (Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)   
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!   
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V (Nervous) What are you talking about?    
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V You're wearing the chocolate shirt!    
p398
tp399
a(V GEORGE 
p400
V I am? What a strange coincidence..    
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..    
p404
tp405
a(V GEORGE 
p406
V (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.   
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?   
p410
tp411
a(V GEORGE 
p412
V No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this    shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Leslie is talking to a group of people, including Elaine)  
p413
tp414
a(V LESLIE 
p415
V We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.   
p416
tp417
a(V ELAINE 
p418
V So, where's Todd?  
p419
tp420
a(V LESLIE 
p421
V Up in Hyannisport.  
p422
tp423
a(V ELAINE 
p424
V Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!    
p425
tp426
a(V WOMAN 
p427
V (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?    
p428
tp429
a(V LESLIE

V March twentieth, nine a.m.  
p431
tp432
a(V WOMAN 
p433
V You know the time!  
p434
tp435
a(V LESLIE 
p436
V I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.   
p437
tp438
a(V ELAINE 
p439
V Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?

p494
tp495
a(V GEORGE 
p496
V What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What,    you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be    ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have    the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like    you!

p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy,     they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?     (Tabachnick and his assistant start to argue, then they start fighting)

p587
tp588
a(V MARY 
p589
V Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong,     Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!   
p590
tp591
a(V JERRY 
p592
V No, I don't think that..  
p593
tp594
a(V MARRY 
p595
V Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your    attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!    (She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms out.

p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..    (Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate cake is now all over George's shirt)

a(V ELAINE 
p652
