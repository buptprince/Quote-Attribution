V  THE CAFE  Written by Tom Leopold     (Comedy club)   There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'      (George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.)    She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.

a(V JERRY 
p4
V This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.   
p5
tp6
a(V GEORGE 
p7
V Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?    
p8
tp9
a(V JERRY 
p10
V What's that smell? What are you wearing?    
p11
tp12
a(V GEORGE 
p13
V Little cologne.  
p14
tp15
a(V JERRY 
p16
V Manly.  
p17
tp18
a(V GEORGE 
p19
V Monica wants me to wear it.  
p20
tp21
a(V JERRY 
p22
V So why didn't you say no?  
p23
tp24
a(V GEORGE 
p25
V I'm too nice.  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.   
p29
tp30
a(V GEORGE 
p31
V She wants me to take an IQ test.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.   
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.    
p38
tp39
a(V JERRY 
p40
V I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.   
p41
tp42
a(V GEORGE 
p43
V You know, I can't talk to you anymore.    
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.   
p47
tp48
a(V GEORGE 
p49
V Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.   
p50
tp51
a(V JERRY 
p52
V Who thinks you're smart?  
p53
tp54
a(V GEORGE 
p55
V I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.   
p56
tp57
a(V JERRY 
p58
V What thing?  
p59
tp60
a(V GEORGE 
p61
V You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!   
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY 
p64
V Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.  
p65
tp66
a(V GEORGE 
p67
V I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.    
p68
tp69
a(V JERRY 
p70
V What did you get?  
p71
tp72
a(V GEORGE 
p73
V What did I get or what do I say I got?    
p74
tp75
a(V JERRY 
p76
V What do you say?  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V I say fourteen o nine (1409).  
p80
tp81
a(V JERRY 
p82
V 1409, that's a good score.  
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V You're telling me.  
p86
tp87
a(V JERRY 
p88
V What did you really get?  
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V You are my friend.  
p92
tp93
a(V JERRY 
p94
V Of course.  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V I tell you everything, right?  
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V I hope so.  
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V Well, this I take to the grave.    (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.)   
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.   
p107
tp108
a(V ELAINE 
p109
V Why do you keep watching?  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.   
p113
tp114
a(V ELAINE 
p115
V And then you flush.  
p116
tp117
a(V JERRY 
p118
V Well, it's a spider.  
p119
tp120
a(V ELAINE 
p121
V You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.    (Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.)  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V Bazooka Joe.   (Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at Elaine who is closer to the door.)   
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V The buzzer.  
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V It's your house.  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?   
p137
tp138
a(V INTERCOM 
p139
V It's George.  
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V Come on up.  
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V Casus belli.  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V What's that?  
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.   
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V Go in, go in!  
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V Have you gone in there?  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.    (George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.)  
p161
tp162
a(V GEORGE 
p163
V Hi.  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.     (Elaine sniffs around.)  
p167
tp168
a(V GEORGE 
p169
V I'm wearing some cologne, all right?    
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V Sure, fine.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Casus belli.  
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Casus belli.  
p179
tp180
a(V GEORGE 
p181
V What's that?  
p182
tp183
a(V ELAINE 
p184
V Since when do you wear cologne?  
p185
tp186
a(V GEORGE 
p187
V Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.   
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?    
p191
tp192
a(V GEORGE 
p193
V I didn't take it yet.  
p194
tp195
a(V ELAINE 
p196
V What IQ test?  
p197
tp198
a(V GEORGE 
p199
V What's casus belli.  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY 
p202
V Oh, it's nothing...  
p203
tp204
a(V GEORGE 
p205
V Is it about me?  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?   
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?   
p212
tp213
a(V JERRY 
p214
V This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.    
p215
tp216
a(V ELAINE 
p217
V Oh, that sounds like fun.  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.   
p221
tp222
a(V ELAINE 
p223
V You'll do well, you're smart.  
p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.   
p227
tp228
a(V ELAINE 
p229
V What did you get on your SAT's?  
p230
tp231
a(V GEORGE 
p232
V It varies.  
p233
tp234
a(V JERRY 
p235
V You know, I don't even know my IQ.    
p236
tp237
a(V ELAINE 
p238
V Mine's 145.  
p239
tp240
a(V GEORGE 
p241
V 145!   
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY 
p244
V Get out of here!  
p245
tp246
a(V ELAINE 
p247
V You get out of here!  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V You get out of here!  
p251
tp252
a(V GEORGE 
p253
V You should take the test for me.  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.   
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?    
p260
tp261
a(V ELAINE 
p262
V What?  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.   
p266
tp267
a(V ELAINE 
p268
V Are you serious?  
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Why not?  
p272
tp273
a(V ELAINE 
p274
V Where would I take the test?  
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.   
p278
tp279
a(V ELAINE 
p280
V No, that would be too noisy.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.   
p284
tp285
a(V ELAINE 
p286
V Hey, what do you think?  
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V Hey, I love a good caper.  
p290
tp291
a(V ELAINE 
p292
V Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.  
p293
tp294
a(V GEORGE 
p295
V You'll do it?  
p296
tp297
a(V ELAINE 
p298
V What the hey.  
p299
tp300
a(V GEORGE 
p301
V Yeaah, beautiful...(They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...     (Dream Cafe. Jerry comes in.)   BABU BHATT  Welcome to the Dream Cafe.  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V Well, I've been looking forward to it.    
p305
tp306
a(V BABU 
p307
V Oh, how did you hear about us?  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V Eh, people, people are talking.  
p311
tp312
a(V BABU 
p313
V Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both.   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Non smoking would be great.  
p317
tp318
a(V BABU 
p319
V Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot face cloth for your pleasure.   
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Thank you. (Throws the towel around like a hot potato.)   
p323
tp324
a(V BABU 
p325
V Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.   
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?   
p329
tp330
a(V BABU 
p331
V Oh, the turkey.  
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.    
p335
tp336
a(V BABU 
p337
V You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...    JERRY THINKS  Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a nobel price?     (George is taking a test at Monica's bedroom.)  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.   
p341
tp342
a(V MONICA 
p343
V But why?  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V I can't concentrate in front of you.    
p347
tp348
a(V MONICA 
p349
V Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.    
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.   
p353
tp354
a(V MONICA 
p355
V Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.   
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.   
p359
tp360
a(V MONICA 
p361
V Good luck.  
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V Don't need it.   (Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting.)   
p365
tp366
a(V ELAINE 
p367
V What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.    
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.   
p371
tp372
a(V ELAINE 
p373
V All right, what time do you want me back here.   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V Eh, twenty to three.  
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V Ok.  
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V Thanks again.  
p383
tp384
a(V ELAINE 
p385
V All right.  
p386
tp387
a(V GEORGE 
p388
V And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.     (Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.)   
p389
tp390
a(V JERRY 
p391
V Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.   
p392
tp393
a(V BABU 
p394
V It is in deed my pleasure.  
p395
tp396
a(V JERRY 
p397
V Oh, please...   (Elaine comes in.)  
p398
tp399
a(V BABU 
p400
V Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today...   
p401
tp402
a(V ELAINE 
p403
V Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.    
p404
tp405
a(V BABU 
p406
V Tea and toast.  
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Eat something! Babu...  
p410
tp411
a(V ELAINE 
p412
V Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.  
p413
tp414
a(V BABU 
p415
V Oh, very good choice. Very good.   (Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.)  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.   
p419
tp420
a(V ELAINE 
p421
V I know.   (Kramer comes in.)  
p422
tp423
a(V KRAMER 
p424
V Hey.  
p425
tp426
a(V JERRY 
p427
V Hey.  
p428
tp429
a(V KRAMER 
p430
V Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...   
p431
tp432
a(V ELAINE 
p433
V Hey.  
p434
tp435
a(V KRAMER 
p436
V This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.   
p437
tp438
a(V JERRY 
p439
V So?  
p440
tp441
a(V KRAMER 
p442
V Well, I'm not giving it back.  
p443
tp444
a(V JERRY 
p445
V Why not?  
p446
tp447
a(V KRAMER 
p448
V Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?    (Kramer takes some nachos and spills some to Elaine's test.)    
p449
tp450
a(V KRAMER 
p451
V Oh, gees...  
p452
tp453
a(V ELAINE 
p454
V Yeah, ok...(takes the test and goes to another table.)   
p455
tp456
a(V KRAMER 
p457
V Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?   
p458
tp459
a(V JERRY 
p460
V Statute.  
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V What?  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.    
p467
tp468
a(V KRAMER 
p469
V No, statue.  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.    
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?   
p476
tp477
a(V ELAINE 
p478
V Statute.  
p479
tp480
a(V KRAMER 
p481
V Oh, I really think you're wrong.  
p482
tp483
a(V ELAINE 
p484
V Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.   
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V What test?  
p488
tp489
a(V ELAINE 
p490
V An IQ test.  
p491
tp492
a(V KRAMER 
p493
V Why do you take an IQ test?  
p494
tp495
a(V ELAINE 
p496
V It's for George.  
p497
tp498
a(V KRAMER 
p499
V George?  
p500
tp501
a(V ELAINE 
p502
V Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?   
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V Why are you taking an IQ test for George?    
p506
tp507
a(V ELAINE 
p508
V Would you please?!  
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V What, is it for a job or something?    
p512
tp513
a(V ELAINE 
p514
V Later!  
p515
tp516
a(V KRAMER 
p517
V You're positive it's statute?  
p518
tp519
a(V ELAINE 
p520
V Yes, yes!  
p521
tp522
a(V BABU 
p523
V Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...(gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams and falls from his chair.)      (Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.)   
p524
tp525
a(V MONICA 
p526
V George?  
p527
tp528
a(V GEORGE 
p529
V Yeah?  
p530
tp531
a(V MONICA

V Oh, it's locked?  
p536
tp537
a(V MONICA 
p538
V I need to get something.  
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.   
p542
tp543
a(V MONICA 
p544
V George!  
p545
tp546
a(V GEORGE 
p547
V Wish I could.    (Dream Cafe. Babu is singing and Elaine gets distracted.)

p590
tp591
a(V JERRY 
p592
V I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.   
p593
tp594
a(V BABU 
p595
V But there are no Pakistani people here.    
p596
tp597
a(V JERRY

p602

V I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, very special.     (Babu leaves)   JERRY THINKING  I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?     (Elaine is giving the test back to George.)

p749
tp750
a(V JERRY
