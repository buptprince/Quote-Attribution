V  THE STAKEOUT  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld   (Opening comedy)   So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of    them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both    of course choose to pay by the use of the (pause and gesture to audience    for response)

V Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you that's    writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that    women are very *fast* with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out so many    cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know    where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for     book from an imaginary holster) ``Who do I make it out to?... There's my    ID...''. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine.    I don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque is like a note    from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if you'll     contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you    just trust me this one time I don't have any money but I have     these... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?''   (End stand-up)

p188
tp189
a(V JERRY

p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V (To himself) What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's    too good to be alone... What's the difference, I can't maneuver     anyway with Elaine next to me...  
p200
tp201
a(V VANESSA 
p202

p221
tp222

p224
tp225
a(V JERRY 
p226
V No kidding... (To himself) Why is this happening? Please, make    her stop!  
p227
tp228
a(V ELAINE 
p229
V I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were    standing there, you were looking out the window--  
p230
tp231
a(V JERRY 
p232
V (To himself) This is *brutal*...  
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE

V You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...   
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY

V How do you like that... (To himself) Can I turn now? Is this    over? No, I can't, I can't... I'm stuck...  
p239
tp240
a(V ELAINE 
p241
V Jerry? Are you listening to me?  
p242
tp243
a(V JERRY

V Yes, I *heard* you.  
p245
tp246
a(V PAMELA

V Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that    time?  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY

V (To himself) Thank *you*, Pamela!  
p251

V Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.   
p257
tp258
a(V JERRY 
p259
V (To himself, quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.    Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft...   (To Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit!    
p260
tp261
a(V VANESSA 
p262
V Oh, that was you!  
p263
tp264
a(V JERRY 
p265

p284

a(V JERRY

V (To himself) I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't even    know her name!    
p287
tp288
a(V JERRY 
p289
V (To himself, *very* quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and    Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...    
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V That wasn't so bad, really...  
p293
tp294
a(V ELAINE 
p295
V Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.   
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Why? What did I do?   
p299
tp300
a(V ELAINE 
p301
V Well, I just don't appreciate these little "courtesy responses",    like I'm selling you aluminum siding.  
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V I was listening!  
p305
tp306
a(V ELAINE 
p307
V No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... "conversation".     
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.   
p311
tp312
a(V ELAINE 
p313
V Uh-huh...   
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.   
p317
tp318
a(V ELAINE 
p319
V No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! *I*    didn't have wooden teeth, *you* did!  
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?   
p323
tp324
a(V ELAINE 
p325
V So nothing... Nothing...   
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic    relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after     himself. He said ``Yeah, I got this new thing-- "platonic". My     idea, my name, callin' it after myself... What I do is, I go *out*    with the girls, I *talk* with them-- don't *do* anything... and go    right home. What'dya think? I think it's going to be *big*!''     I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get     relationships named after them, but it didn't work. Y'know, I bet     Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a   *"Riconic"* relationship...''    
p329
tp330
a(V JERRY 
p331
V Hey!  
p332
tp333
a(V MORTY 
p334
V Ah, there he is!  
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your    bed!  
p338
tp339
a(V HELEN 
p340
V Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...    
p341
tp342
a(V JERRY 
p343
V What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here...   
p344
tp345
a(V HELEN 
p346
V Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.  
p347
tp348
a(V JERRY 
p349
V Ma, will you stop?  
p350
tp351
a(V HELEN 
p352
V No, why should we take over your apartment?    
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.    
p356
tp357
a(V HELEN 
p358
V Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?  
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V No, he's making a bouillabaisse.  
p362
tp363
a(V JERRY 
p364
V So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big    law offices?  
p365
tp366
a(V MORTY 
p367
V Depends on the firm.  
p368
tp369
a(V JERRY 
p370
V Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they    would know who it was?  
p371
tp372
a(V MORTY 
p373
V What's the matter? You need a lawyer?    
p374
tp375
a(V JERRY 
p376
V No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I    don't know her name.  
p377
tp378
a(V MORTY 
p379
V So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?   
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.   
p383
tp384
a(V HELEN 
p385
V Why not?  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.   
p389
tp390
a(V HELEN 
p391
V He used to go with her...  
p392
tp393
a(V HELEN 
p394
V Which one is she?  
p395
tp396
a(V MORTY 
p397
V From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered    cherries you didn't like.  
p398
tp399
a(V MORTY 
p400
V Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.  
p401
tp402
a(V JERRY 
p403
V Oh yeah, she's great.  
p404
tp405
a(V HELEN 
p406
V So, how come nothing materialized there?    
p407
tp408
a(V JERRY 
p409
V Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...   
p410
tp411
a(V HELEN 
p412
V I know what it was...  
p413
tp414
a(V JERRY 
p415
V You don't know what it was...  
p416
tp417
a(V HELEN 
p418
V So, what was it?  
p419
tp420
a(V JERRY 
p421
V Well, we fight a lot for some reason...       H + M  Oh, well...  
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...     
p425
tp426
a(V HELEN 
p427
V Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.   
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V Oh, she is, she absolutely is.  
p431
tp432
a(V HELEN 
p433
V I can see if there was a *weight* problem...    
p434
tp435
a(V JERRY 
p436
V No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.     
p437
tp438
a(V HELEN 
p439
V You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.    
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V I know, I know...  
p443
tp444
a(V MORTY 
p445
V Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.   
p446
tp447
a(V HELEN 
p448
V Idiot... (To Jerry) So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?   
p449
tp450
a(V JERRY 
p451
V That's got *nothin'* to do with it.    
p452
tp453
a(V MORTY 
p454
V How about Loni Anderson?  
p455
tp456
a(V HELEN 
p457
V Where do you get Loni Anderson?  
p458
tp459
a(V MORTY 
p460
V Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?    
p461
tp462
a(V HELEN 
p463
V I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...     
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't "the one".   
p467
tp468
a(V HELEN 
p469
V And this other one's "the one"?  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V I dunno, maybe...  
p473
tp474
a(V MORTY 
p475
V So ask Elaine there for the number.    
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her,    especially this one tonight.  
p479
tp480
a(V HELEN 
p481
V How could you still see her if your not interested?   
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V We're *friends*.  
p485
tp486
a(V MORTY 
p487
V Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd    ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?    
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V Oh yeah...   
p491
tp492
a(V MORTY 
p493
V Well, go up to the office.  
p494
tp495
a(V HELEN 
p496
V Up to her office?  
p497
tp498
a(V MORTY 
p499
V Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?   
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V I guess...  
p503
tp504
a(V MORTY 
p505
V So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to    come down for lunch.  
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V You mean "stakeout" the lobby?  
p509
tp510
a(V HELEN 
p511
V Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!   
p512
tp513
a(V MORTY 
p514
V He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.   
p515
tp516
a(V HELEN 
p517
V So you've got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! What    happens when he sees her?  
p518
tp519
a(V MORTY 
p520
V He pretends he *bumped* into her!  
p521
tp522
a(V JERRY

tp582
a(V GEORGE

a(V GEORGE 
p706
V Uh, railroads, uh...  
p707
tp708

p712
V They can...  
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.

V I'll just, uh, get a paper...  
p731
tp732
a(V JERRY 
p733
V So, um, do you date immature men?  
p734
tp735
a(V VANESSA 
p736
V Almost exclusively...        
p737
tp738
a(V HELEN 
p739
V Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...   
p740
tp741
a(V JERRY 
p742
V Ma, will you go already?  
p743
tp744
a(V HELEN 
p745
V Bum bum bum bum...   
p746
tp747
a(V JERRY

V What are you doing?!  
p749
tp750
a(V HELEN 
p751
V Wait, I just want to see something...    
p752
tp753
a(V JERRY 
p754
V You can't look in there, we're playing!

tp756
a(V MORTY 
p757
V Evening, Mr. Kramer!  
p758
tp759
a(V KRAMER

V Hey Morty! (To Jerry) Salad dressing?    
p761
tp762
a(V JERRY 
p763
V Look.  
p764
tp765
a(V HELEN 
p766
V "Quo"? Is that a word?  
p767
tp768
a(V JERRY 
p769
V Maybe!  
p770
tp771
a(V HELEN 
p772
V Will you challenge it?  
p773
tp774
a(V JERRY 
p775
V Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's cheating!   
p776
tp777
a(V KRAMER 
p778
V "Quo"? That's not a word.  
p779
tp780
a(V HELEN 
p781
V (To Jerry) You're such a stickler...    
p782
tp783
a(V JERRY 
p784
V Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes on this.    So is Uncle Mac, and Artie, they're all coming over here before the    wedding?  
p785
tp786
a(V HELEN 
p787
V They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said    SHE'D BE HERE AT 2  30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went    well with Art... "Vandelay"?''  
p788
tp789
a(V JERRY 
p790
V She said *what*?  
p791
tp792
a(V HELEN 
p793
V Just what I said, here.   
p794
tp795
a(V JERRY 
p796
V She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*...    
p797
tp798
a(V HELEN 
p799
V She knows what?  
p800
tp801
a(V JERRY 
p802
V She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...    
p803
tp804
a(V HELEN 
p805
V No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a "Z"...   
p806
tp807
a(V MORTY 
p808
V So, how did she find out?  
p809
tp810
a(V JERRY 
p811
V Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told    Elaine.     
p812
tp813
a(V MORTY 
p814
V So, what are you? Afraid of her?  
p815
tp816
a(V JERRY 
p817
V Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!  
p818
tp819
a(V JERRY 
p820
V What else did she say on the phone?    
p821
tp822
a(V HELEN 
p823
V Whatever I wrote down.  
p824
tp825
a(V JERRY 
p826
V Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?   
p827
tp828
a(V HELEN 
p829
V Who am I, Rich Little?  
p830
tp831
a(V MORTY 
p832
V Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding.   
p833
tp834
a(V JERRY 
p835
V Yeah, but now I'm nervous.  
p836
tp837
a(V HELEN 
p838
V Oh, stop it.   
p839
tp840
a(V JERRY 
p841
V "Quone"?  
p842
tp843
a(V HELEN 
p844
V ...30...31...   
p845
tp846
a(V JERRY 
p847
V "Quone"? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that.   
p848
tp849
a(V HELEN 
p850
V ...32...   
p851
tp852
a(V KRAMER 
p853
V No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a    *definite* word.  
p854
tp855
a(V JERRY 
p856
V I am challenging...  
p857
tp858
a(V KRAMER 
p859
V Quone: to quone something.  
p860
tp861
a(V JERRY 
p862
V Uh-huh...  
p863
tp864
a(V HELEN 
p865
V I'm not playing with you anymore...    
p866
tp867
a(V MORTY 
p868
V Quone's not a word...  
p869
tp870
a(V JERRY 
p871
V No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...   
p872
tp873
a(V HELEN 
p874
V Why did you make me put that down?    
p875
tp876
a(V KRAMER 
p877
V Nah, we need a *medical* dictionary! If a patient gets difficult,    you *quone* him...     
p878
tp879
a(V CAROL 
p880
V You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work,    now that's a sitcom!  
p881
tp882
a(V JERRY 
p883
V You must have quite a time down there. (Checks his watch)   
p884
tp885
a(V CAROL 
p886
V We got plenty of time...  
p887
tp888
a(V JERRY 
p889
V Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone...   
p890
tp891
a(V MAC 
p892
V Watch what you say to this guy-- he'll put it in his next act!   
p893
tp894
a(V JERRY 
p895
V Yeah, yeah...  
p896
tp897
a(V MAC 
p898
V Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography.   
p899
tp900
a(V JERRY 
p901
V Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...    
p902
tp903
a(V MAC 
p904
V It's based on all my experiences!  
p905
tp906
a(V JERRY 
p907
V That's perfect. (Elaine enters) Could you excuse me one second.    I'm sorry.   
p908
tp909
a(V JERRY 
p910
V How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld.  
p911
tp912
a(V ELAINE 
p913
V Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes.  
p914
tp915
a(V JERRY 
p916
V Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get    in the car?  
p917
tp918
a(V ELAINE 
p919
V Oh no, let's do it now.  
p920
tp921
a(V JERRY 
p922
V Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--   
p923
tp924
a(V ELAINE 
p925
V Okay...  
p926
tp927
a(V ARTIE 
p928
V Jerry, were you goin' with us?  
p929
tp930
a(V JERRY 
p931
V No, I'm gonna take my car.  
p932
tp933
a(V ARTIE 
p934
V That's why I brought the wagon. Why the Hell did I bring the wagon?   
p935
tp936
a(V JERRY 
p937
V Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so    uncomfortable, and you were *so* annoyed in the cab.  
p938
tp939
a(V ELAINE 
p940
V Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was    quite the spectacle.  
p941
tp942
a(V CAROL 
p943
V Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine.    
p944
tp945
a(V ELAINE 
p946
V Oh, bye. Good to see you.  
p947
tp948
a(V ARTIE 
p949
V Oh, we didn't meet.  
p950
tp951
a(V JERRY 
p952
V Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine.    
p953
tp954
a(V ARTIE 
p955
V Le*vine*.   
p956
tp957
a(V JERRY 
p958
V Yeah, "Le*vine*". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... Anyway, I    admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean,     obviously we have a little problem here.  
p959
tp960
a(V ELAINE 
p961
V Yeah, obviously.  
p962
tp963
a(V JERRY 
p964
V I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about    other people...  
p965
tp966
a(V ELAINE 
p967
V Couldn't agree more.  
p968
tp969
a(V JERRY 
p970
V Good.  
p971
tp972
a(V ELAINE 
p973
V Good.  
p974
tp975
a(V JERRY 
p976
V Good.  
p977
tp978
a(V ELAINE 
p979
V Great!  
p980
tp981
a(V JERRY 
p982
V Great? Where do you get "great"?  
p983
tp984
a(V ELAINE 
p985
V It's great to... talk about... other people...   
p986
tp987
a(V JERRY 
p988
V ...Guys.  
p989
tp990
a(V ELAINE 
p991
V Yeah.  
p992
tp993
a(V JERRY 
p994
V Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?    
p995
tp996
a(V ELAINE 
p997
V No. A general guy.  
p998
tp999
a(V JERRY 
p1000
V Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...    
p1001
tp1002
a(V ELAINE 
p1003
V What? No, it's not a big deal.  
p1004
tp1005
a(V JERRY 
p1006
V No, that's great! That's terrific!    
p1007
tp1008
a(V ELAINE 
p1009
V No, we just met...  
p1010
tp1011
a(V JERRY 
p1012
V Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to    meet him.  
p1013
tp1014
a(V ELAINE 
p1015
V I don't think so...  
p1016
tp1017
a(V JERRY 
p1018
V Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer    of some sort?  
p1019
tp1020
a(V ELAINE 
p1021
V Wall street.  
p1022
tp1023
a(V JERRY 
p1024
V Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut.   
p1025
tp1026
a(V ELAINE 
p1027
V And he happens to be pretty good lookin'    
p1028
tp1029
a(V JERRY 
p1030
V (pause) Alright, sir.  
p1031
tp1032
a(V ELAINE 
p1033
V And... he's *hilarious*.  
p1034
tp1035
a(V JERRY 
p1036
V Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?   
p1037
tp1038
a(V ELAINE 
p1039
V I "staked" out his health club.    
p1040
tp1041
a(V JERRY 
p1042
V When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand up    against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?...     
p1043
tp1044
a.
