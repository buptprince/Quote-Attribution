V  THE KEYS  Written by Larry Charles     (Comedy club)   So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."    OPENING SCENE  Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.    JERRY'S BRAIN  What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.    (Jerry notices his door is open.)   JERRY'S BRAIN  What the hell...? Why is the door open?     (Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns on the light.)    Kramer, what are you doing here!?

V Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.

a(V KRAMER 
p43
V My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)   
p44
tp45
a(V JERRY 
p46
V Is that my towel?   (Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's floor from the other side of the door.)        New scene. Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door with a girlfriend.

V Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!  
p62
tp63
a(V JERRY

p65
tp66

a(V JERRY

p71
tp72
a(V GIRLFRIEND 
p73
V You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)

tp96
a(V KRAMER 
p97
V What, what, I thought you went to the movies!   
p98
tp99
a(V JERRY 
p100
V It was sold out!  
p101
tp102
a(V KRAMER 
p103
V Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?   
p104
tp105
a(V JERRY 
p106
V That's the point.  
p107
tp108
a(V KRAMER 
p109
V What point?  
p110
tp111
a(V JERRY 
p112
V Just, look, just give the keys.

V Don't ask me!

tp120
a(V KRAMER 
p121
V I'm asking you!  
p122
tp123
a(V JERRY 
p124
V I'm telling you.  
p125
tp126
a(V KRAMER 
p127
V You're joking.  
p128
tp129
a(V JERRY 
p130
V I'm serious!  
p131
tp132
a(V KRAMER 
p133
V It's not going to happen again!  
p134
tp135
a(V JERRY 
p136
V Yes it will, now give me those keys!     (Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down with him.)   
p137
tp138
a(V KRAMER 
p139
V O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)         New scene. Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving his spare keys to Elaine.   
p140
tp141
a(V JERRY 
p142
V So put 'em in a safe place.  
p143
tp144
a(V ELAINE 
p145
V I will.  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V Where?  
p149
tp150
a(V ELAINE 
p151
V I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?   
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.   
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.   
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V I can't.   (There's a gentle knock at the door.)  
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V Who's there?  
p167
tp168
a(V KRAMER 
p169
V Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...   
p170
tp171
a(V ELAINE 
p172
V Oh, I'm not, uh...  
p173
tp174
a(V KRAMER 
p175
V No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."   
p176
tp177
a(V ELAINE 
p178
V Jerry, give him the keys back.  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V Elaine...   (Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer breaks it up.)   
p182
tp183
a(V KRAMER 
p184
V I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.   
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Take the keys.  
p188
tp189
a(V KRAMER 
p190
V I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)   
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V O.K.!   
p194
tp195
a(V KRAMER 
p196
V Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.   
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V Your spare set?  
p200
tp201
a(V KRAMER 
p202
V That's right.  
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V You want 'em back?  
p206
tp207
a(V KRAMER 
p208
V Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.    (Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)         New scene at the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring to George.   
p209
tp210
a(V GEORGE 
p211
V Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.   
p212
tp213
a(V KRAMER 
p214
V Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!  
p215
tp216
a(V GEORGE 
p217
V Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.   
p218
tp219
a(V KRAMER 
p220
V Well, you can get 'em back.  
p221
tp222
a(V GEORGE 
p223
V I suppose I could.  
p224
tp225
a(V KRAMER 
p226
V Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.   
p227
tp228
a(V GEORGE 
p229
V Me?  
p230
tp231
a(V KRAMER 
p232
V Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.    
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)    
p236
tp237

p238
V Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)    
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V Do you ever yearn?  
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V Yearn? Do I yearn?  
p245
tp246
a(V KRAMER 
p247
V I yearn.  
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V You yearn.  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?    
p254
tp255
a(V GEORGE 
p256
V Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.   
p257
tp258
a(V KRAMER 
p259
V Look at you.  
p260
tp261
a(V GEORGE 
p262
V Aw, Kramer, don't start...  
p263
tp264
a(V KRAMER 
p265
V You're wasting your life.  
p266
tp267
a(V GEORGE 
p268
V I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!   
p269
tp270
a(V KRAMER 
p271
V O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?   
p272
tp273
a(V GEORGE 
p274
V No.  
p275
tp276
a(V KRAMER 
p277
V You got money?  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V No.  
p281
tp282
a(V KRAMER 
p283
V Do you have a woman?  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V No.  
p287
tp288
a(V KRAMER 
p289
V Do you have any prospects?  
p290
tp291
a(V GEORGE 
p292
V No.  
p293
tp294
a(V KRAMER 
p295
V You got anything on the horizon?  
p296
tp297
a(V GEORGE 
p298
V Uh...no.  
p299
tp300
a(V KRAMER 
p301
V Do you have any action at all?  
p302
tp303

p304
V No.  
p305
tp306
a(V KRAMER 
p307
V Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?   
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V I like to get the Daily News!  
p311
tp312
a(V KRAMER 
p313
V George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.   
p314
tp315
a(V GEORGE 
p316
V Why?  
p317
tp318
a(V KRAMER 
p319
V I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.   
p320
tp321
a(V GEORGE 
p322
V Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.   
p323
tp324
a(V KRAMER 
p325
V No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.   
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!    
p329
tp330
a(V KRAMER 
p331
V I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?    
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V Uh, no, I'm not.  
p335
tp336
a(V KRAMER 
p337
V Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)   
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V You're not really gonna go to California, are you?   
p341
tp342
a(V KRAMER 
p343
V Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)         New scene, Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up his spare keys from Elaine.   
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.   
p347
tp348
a(V ELAINE 
p349
V Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?   
p350
tp351
a(V GEORGE 
p352
V I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."   
p353
tp354
a(V ELAINE 
p355
V That's ridiculous.  
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V That's Kramer.  
p359
tp360
a(V ELAINE 
p361
V I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.   
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V What for?  
p365
tp366
a(V ELAINE 
p367
V 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.  
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V Jerry? Why?  
p371
tp372
a(V ELAINE 
p373
V 'Cause he gave me his.  
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V So what?  
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V So, if he has my keys, I should have his.   
p380
tp381
a(V GEORGE 
p382
V Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.   
p383
tp384
a(V ELAINE

p386

tp390
a(V ELAINE 
p391
V What?  
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?   
p395
tp396
a(V ELAINE 
p397
V Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.        New scene, Jerry's apartment the next day.

tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Did you bring the keys?  
p401
tp402
a(V GEORGE 
p403
V Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.   
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V This could be an emergency!  
p407
tp408
a(V GEORGE 
p409
V You never should have taken away his keys!   
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)    
p413
tp414
a(V GEORGE 
p415
V How'd the Mets do?  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418

V We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.   
p488
tp489
a(V NEWMAN 
p490
V You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.   
p491
tp492

p493
V Bad rap?

a(V JERRY

p503

V I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?   
p509
tp510
a(V ELAINE 
p511
V Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullsh*t.

V I heard you say something, there.

a(V JERRY 
p538
V I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!   
p539
tp540
a(V GEORGE 
p541
V Ask her about Kramer.  
p542
tp543
a(V JERRY 
p544
V She's drunk out of her mind.   (Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the highway. He tries to thumb a ride.)        New scene, Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the coffee shop to call Elaine.   
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.        New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a motorcycle.   
p548

V Hey! You ever been in an accident?    
p551
tp552
a(V BIKER 
p553
V About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)        New scene. Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. George enters, spare keys in hand.

V Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.    
p557
tp558
a(V GEORGE 
p559
V Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.    
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V Don't feel right? What are you talking about?   
p563
tp564
a(V GEORGE 
p565
V Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?   
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V What is the big deal?  
p569
tp570
a(V GEORGE 
p571
V Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.   
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.    
p575
tp576
a(V GEORGE 
p577
V Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.    
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)   
p581
tp582
a(V GEORGE 
p583
V Nope, no can do.  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!   
p587

a(V JERRY 
p592
V Do you wanna fight?  
p593
tp594
a(V GEORGE 
p595
V I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)        New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them a story as they go down the road...   
p596
tp597
a(V KRAMER 
p598
V And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.    HIPPIE #1  Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.   
p599
tp600
a(V KRAMER 
p601
V Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.     HIPPIE #1  Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?   
p602
tp603
a(V KRAMER 
p604
V Oh, he's cold.   HIPPIE #1  Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM!  I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE  A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!   
p605
tp606
a(V KRAMER 
p607
V Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!    HIPPIE #1  Hey, what's the rush, man?  
p608
tp609
a(V KRAMER 
p610
V Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.     HIPPIE #1  Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?   
p611
tp612
a(V KRAMER 
p613
V What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)     HIPPIE #2  Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)        New scene, Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.   
p614
tp615
a(V JERRY 
p616
V Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.   
p617
tp618
a(V GEORGE 
p619
V You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.   
p620
tp621
a(V JERRY 
p622
V What's that?  
p623
tp624
a(V GEORGE

tp627
a(V JERRY 
p628
V I heard something.  
p629
tp630
a(V GEORGE 
p631
V Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)        New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.   
p632
tp633
a(V KRAMER 
p634
V So, how long you been drivin' this thing?    
p635
tp636
a(V WOMAN 
p637
V Goin' on four years.

a(V KRAMER

V Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.   
p641
tp642
a(V WOMAN 
p643
V Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.   
p644
tp645
a(V KRAMER 
p646
V You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.   
p647
tp648
a(V WOMAN 
p649
V You want to give it a try?  
p650
tp651

a(V KRAMER 
p658
V Yeah.  
p659
tp660
a(V WOMAN 
p661
V Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)        New scene, Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for Jerry's spare keys.   
p662

V Well, this is great.  
p668
tp669
a(V GEORGE 
p670
V Well, what do they look like?  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."   
p674
tp675
a(V GEORGE 
p676
V Well, they're obviously not here.  
p677
tp678

V Why didn't she tell us?  
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY

V Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)

V It was funny!

a(V ELAINE

p734

a(V JERRY 
p736
V Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...   
p737
tp738
a(V ELAINE 
p739
V Well, it's just a first draft!

V Is that something you want to do?  
p803
tp804
a(V ELAINE

V I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.   
p806
tp807
a(V JERRY 
p808
V Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.   
p809
tp810
a(V ELAINE 
p811
V O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
