aV  THE ROBBERY  Written by Matt Goldman     (Comedy club)   So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this    women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that     I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me...     the finger. It seems like such an... arbitrary, ridiculous   thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person.   (shows several fingers to the audience) It's a finger, what     does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm     supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? 
p3
aa(lp4
V I 
p5
aV   mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't     you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the     finger. 'Cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've     gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and     uh (pretends to drive with one foot in the air and speaks to     person driving next to him) look at that toe, buddy. (puts his     foot down) I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe,   isn't it ?     (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is packing. Elaine is sitting   at the table watching Jerry)  
p6
aa(lp7
V JERRY 
p8
aV Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella,    something boring to read on the plane. (zips his bag with   exaggerated motions) That's it. Done!  
p9
aa(lp10
V ELAINE 
p11
aV (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing    performance I have ever seen.  
p12
aa(lp13
V JERRY 
p14
aV (proudly) I am...the master packer.    
p15
aa(lp16
V ELAINE 
p17
aV (laughs) Yeah, right, you're the master packer.   
p18
aa(lp19
V JERRY 
p20
aV What you must understand, Elaine, (picks up the    umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into  
p21
aa(lp22
V BATTLE 
p23
aV you've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses (hits    his bag rhythmically with his umbrella) of every soldier in     that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of   ordinary black socks.  
p24
aa(lp25
V ELAINE 
p26
aV 'Scuse me...master packer!  
p27
aa(lp28

aV Just gimme your keys.  
p33
aa(lp34
V JERRY

p36
aa(lp37
V GEORGE 
p38
aV (outside over the intercom) Yeah  
p39
aa(lp40
V ELAINE 
p41
aV (Jerry opens the door) OK, so, now, is there anything    else I need to know 'bout this place?  
p42
aa(lp43
V JERRY 
p44
aV uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to    come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all   your shopping, you...come back and take a shower.  
p45
aa(lp46
V ELAINE 
p47
aV OK, this is quite a place.  
p48
aa(lp49
V JERRY 
p50
aV There's more, the refrigerator. (Opens it) Deduct a    minimum of two days of all expiration dates. (uses the   umbrella to point to certain compartments in the refrigerator)     No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (closes the refrigerator)      that clear?  
p51
aa(lp52
V ELAINE 
p53
aV I'll eat out.  
p54
aa(lp55
V JERRY 
p56
aV One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity:    strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a     BIG FAVOUR  do it in the tub.  
p57
aa(lp58
V GEORGE 
p59
aV (walks in) Ready?  
p60
aa(lp61
V JERRY 
p62
aV Yeah, one sec.  
p63
aa(lp64

p65
aV (closes the door) Hey, Elaine  
p66
aa(lp67
V ELAINE 
p68

p69
aa(lp70
V GEORGE 
p71
aV Coming to the airport with us?  
p72
aa(lp73
V ELAINE 
p74
aV No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a    break from my roommate.  
p75
aa(lp76
V GEORGE 
p77
aV Oh, the actress-waitress.  
p78
aa(lp79
V ELAINE 
p80
aV No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in    some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day     "God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it". She's gonna get it     right in her...  
p81
aa(lp82
V GEORGE 
p83
aV You just kick her out.  
p84
aa(lp85
V ELAINE 
p86
aV She's on the lease!...George you have got to find an    other place for me.  
p87
aa(lp88
V GEORGE 
p89
aV Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in    your price-range. (looks like he remembers something and turns     to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.  
p90
aa(lp91
V JERRY 
p92
aV I'm not looking.  
p93
aa(lp94
V GEORGE 
p95
aV No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!   
p96
aa(lp97
V JERRY 
p98
aV Yeah, what's it like?  
p99
aa(lp100
V GEORGE 
p101
aV I haven't seen it yet, but it's a "two-bedroom", it's    on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park?  
p102
aa(lp103
V JERRY 
p104
aV How much?  
p105
aa(lp106
V GEORGE 
p107
aV Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great    building, it's two bedrooms!  
p108
aa(lp109
V JERRY 
p110
aV Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough    trouble maintaining activity in one. (George looks at Elaine     with a "he's-crazy-look"; Jerry turns around) I saw that.  
p111
aa(lp112
V ELAINE 
p113
aV You oughtta least take a look at it.    
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV Really? Why?  
p117
aa(lp118
V ELAINE 
p119
aV 'Cause then I could move in here.  
p120
aa(lp121
V JERRY 
p122
aV Ooohhhh  
p123
aa(lp124
V ELAINE 
p125
aV It's time you got out a here anyway.    
p126
aa(lp127
V GEORGE 
p128
aV Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.   
p129
aa(lp130
V ELAINE 
p131
aV Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have    no hot water, you can't have soft cheese...  
p132
aa(lp133
V GEORGE 
p134
aV Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on    here for ten years; no human can turn this off.  
p135
aa(lp136
V ELAINE 
p137
aV Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at    least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live     like this.  
p138
aa(lp139
V JERRY 
p140
aV Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here.   
p141
aa(lp142
V ELAINE 
p143
aV Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from    Island to Finland.  
p144
aa(lp145
V GEORGE 
p146
aV Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the    place or not?  
p147
aa(lp148
V JERRY 
p149
aV I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to    Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.     (Jerry's apartment. Jerry enters his apartment with his   bags.)  
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV Elaine! (puts his bags down, sits down on the couch,    picks up the remote control and tries to turn on his TV)  
p153
aa(lp154
V JERRY 
p155
aV (notices the TV is missing) ELAINE!    
p156
aa(lp157
V ELAINE

p159
aa(lp160
V JERRY 
p161
aV Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR.    (Elaine looks guilty) What?  
p162
aa(lp163
V ELAINE 
p164
aV They were stolen.  
p165
aa(lp166
V JERRY 
p167
aV Stolen? When?

aa(lp169
V ELAINE

aV A couple a hours ago, the police are coming right    over.  
p171
aa(lp172

p174
aa(lp175
V ELAINE 
p176
aV (Kramer enters the apartment) Someone left the door    open. (it's clear that she means Kramer; she walks to the   bathroom)  
p177
aa(lp178
V JERRY 
p179
aV (to Kramer) You left the door open?!    
p180
aa(lp181
V KRAMER 
p182
aV Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I    came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause     I was gonna bring the spatula right back!  
p183
aa(lp184
V JERRY 
p185
aV Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?   
p186
aa(lp187
V KRAMER 
p188
aV (bobs his head guiltily) The door.    
p189
aa(lp190
V JERRY 
p191
aV The door? You left the door open?  
p192
aa(lp193
V KRAMER 
p194
aV Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.   
p195

p204
aa(lp205
V KRAMER 
p206
aV Wide open!  
p207
aa(lp208
V JERRY 
p209
aV (Elaine enters the living-room) And where were you?   
p210
aa(lp211
V ELAINE 
p212
aV I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to    heat up.  
p213
aa(lp214
V KRAMER 
p215
aV Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh, you have insurance,    right buddy?  
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV No.  
p219
aa(lp220
V KRAMER 
p221
aV (looks shocked) How can you not have insurance?   
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's    the most impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only     ONE DESIGN FLAW  the door...(shuts the door) must be  CLOSED.   
p225
aa(lp226
V KRAMER 
p227
aV Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it,    I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case!  
p228
aa(lp229
V JERRY 
p230
aV Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an    accident.  
p231
aa(lp232
V KRAMER 
p233
aV (theatrical) I made a mistake.  
p234
aa(lp235
V ELAINE 
p236
aV (idem) These things happen  
p237
aa(lp238
V KRAMER 
p239
aV (idem) I'm human  
p240
aa(lp241
V JERRY 
p242
aV In your way.   (Jerry's apartment. A policeman is filling out a   report. Jerry and Elaine are there.)  
p243
aa(lp244
V POLICEMAN 
p245
aV Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather    jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it?  
p246
aa(lp247
V ELAINE 
p248
aV Answering machine.  
p249
aa(lp250
V JERRY 
p251
aV (disappointed) Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea    of somebody out there returning my calls.  
p252
aa(lp253
V POLICEMAN 
p254
aV What do ya mean?  
p255
aa(lp256
V JERRY 
p257
aV It's a joke.  
p258
aa(lp259
V POLICEMAN 
p260
aV I see...Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into    it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find     anything.  
p261
aa(lp262
V JERRY 
p263
aV You ever find anything?  
p264
aa(lp265
V POLICEMAN 
p266
aV No. (hands Jerry his copy of the report)    
p267
aa(lp268
V JERRY 
p269
aV Well, thanks anyway.  
p270
aa(lp271
V POLICEMAN 
p272
aV You bet.  
p273
aa(lp274
V ELAINE 
p275
aV (Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters)    I didn't get that joke either.  
p276
aa(lp277
V JERRY 
p278
aV The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him.    HE'S THE CROOK  why would he answer...(turns around and sees    George standing behind him) How did you get in here?  
p279
aa(lp280
V GEORGE 
p281
aV (makes some weird motions) I walked in, your lobby    door is broken again.  
p282
aa(lp283
V JERRY 
p284
aV Again.  
p285
aa(lp286
V GEORGE 
p287
aV I don't know how you put up with this.    
p288
aa(lp289
V ELAINE 
p290
aV Yeah, tell'm George.  
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?   
p294
aa(lp295
V ELAINE 
p296
aV Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel    Merman without the talent.  
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still    available. (George shows him the keys)     (Comedy club.)  
p300
aa(lp301
V JERRY 
p302
aV I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now,    the first couple a times you go through it, it's very   upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will    
p303
aa(lp304
V SAY 
p305
aV "Call the police. You really should call the police." So     "Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna     see some real action." Right, you think that. So, the police      GIVE YOU  your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his    copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do   you?...It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the     city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few     crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for   their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot.     "Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin...I think we can     round him up, he's dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him,     he's a PENGUIN!     (The apartment on 83rd street. George, Elaine and Jerry   are entering the apartment.)  
p306
aa(lp307

p309
aa(lp310

V JERRY 
p314
aV How do you get all that wood in here?

p327
aa(lp328

p330
aa(lp331
V ELAINE 
p332
aV Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden.   
p333
aa(lp334
V GEORGE 
p335
aV A garden! I can't believe there's a garden!   
p336

p351
aa(lp352
V ELAINE 
p353
aV You can tip a gardener.  
p354
aa(lp355
V GEORGE 
p356
aV You don't need a gardener.  
p357
aa(lp358
V ELAINE 
p359
aV Jerry, you can barbecue back here (points to garden).   
p360
aa(lp361
V JERRY 
p362
aV They deliver the coal?  
p363
aa(lp364
V ELAINE 
p365
aV Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the    wood.  
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY

aV Oh, than I gotta tip him.  
p369
aa(lp370

p375
aa(lp376

p377
aV I have plants.  
p378
aa(lp379
V ELAINE 
p380
aV Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking    in it! (walks in the closet) It's a "walk-in". Can you believe     it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?!  
p381
aa(lp382
V JERRY 
p383
aV (closes the closet with Elaine still in it)...I like    that. (opens the closet, Elaine walks out with an angry look)     What do ya think, George?  
p384
aa(lp385
V GEORGE 
p386
aV It's your decision.  
p387
aa(lp388
V JERRY 
p389
aV (walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying    his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking; Elaine is not     able to copy this "move"; they look at each other laughing)     I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place, I'm gonna take it, this     is gonna be my new place, I'm livin' here...I'm movin'.  
p390
aa(lp391

p408
aa(lp409
V ELAINE

aV Yeah.  
p639
aa(lp640

p675
aa(lp676
V JERRY 
p677
aV One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid,    you have a certain way of working out disagreements...and   those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main way     that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them    
p678
aa(lp679
V SAY 
p680
aV "I got the front seat" (other kid's voice) "I wanted the    front seat!" (first kid again) "I called it". And the other      called it, what can I do?". If there was a "kid-court of law"     IT HOLDS UP  (lawyer's voice) "Your Honour, my client did ask     it?" (lawyer's voice again) "Well no, he didn't call..." BANG!     (imitating a hammer being hit by the judge); (judges voice   again) "He has to call it, case closed...objection overruled".       (Coffee house, called Monk's; Jerry is sitting at a   table, George is returning from the bathroom)  
p681
aa(lp682
V GEORGE

aV (walks towards the table) I love the mirror in that     in that mirror. (sits down) I don't know if it's the tile or     the lighting...I feel like Robert Wagner.  
p684
aa(lp685
V JERRY 
p686
aV (bobs his head) It's a good mirror...(both look at    their menus) So, what are ya gettin'?  
p687
aa(lp688
V GEORGE 
p689
aV I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything     FRENCH FRIES  out, BLT: out!...I go to visit my grandparents:     three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot!      you eat that stuff?!"...(they look at their menus again) I'm     so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know.
