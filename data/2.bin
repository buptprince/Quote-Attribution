V  THE ROBBERY  Written by Matt Goldman     (Comedy club)   So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this    women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that     I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me...     the finger. It seems like such an... arbitrary, ridiculous   thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person.   (shows several fingers to the audience) It's a finger, what     does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm     supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? 
p2
tp3
a(V I 
p4
V   mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't     you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the     finger. 'Cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've     gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and     uh (pretends to drive with one foot in the air and speaks to     person driving next to him) look at that toe, buddy. (puts his     foot down) I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe,   isn't it ?     (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is packing. Elaine is sitting   at the table watching Jerry)  
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella,    something boring to read on the plane. (zips his bag with   exaggerated motions) That's it. Done!  
p8
tp9
a(V ELAINE 
p10
V (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing    performance I have ever seen.  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V (proudly) I am...the master packer.    
p14
tp15
a(V ELAINE 
p16
V (laughs) Yeah, right, you're the master packer.   
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V What you must understand, Elaine, (picks up the    umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into  
p20
tp21
a(V BATTLE 
p22
V you've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses (hits    his bag rhythmically with his umbrella) of every soldier in     that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of   ordinary black socks.  
p23
tp24
a(V ELAINE 
p25
V 'Scuse me...master packer!  
p26
tp27
a(V JERRY 
p28
V ...Yes.  
p29
tp30
a(V ELAINE 
p31
V Just gimme your keys.  
p32
tp33
a(V JERRY 
p34
V Alright, sir. (tosses Elaine his keys; apartment buzzer    goes of, Jerry speaks over the intercom) George?  
p35
tp36
a(V GEORGE 
p37
V (outside over the intercom) Yeah  
p38
tp39
a(V ELAINE 
p40
V (Jerry opens the door) OK, so, now, is there anything    else I need to know 'bout this place?  
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to    come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all   your shopping, you...come back and take a shower.  
p44
tp45
a(V ELAINE 
p46
V OK, this is quite a place.  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V There's more, the refrigerator. (Opens it) Deduct a    minimum of two days of all expiration dates. (uses the   umbrella to point to certain compartments in the refrigerator)     No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (closes the refrigerator)      that clear?  
p50
tp51
a(V ELAINE 
p52
V I'll eat out.  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity:    strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a     BIG FAVOUR  do it in the tub.  
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V (walks in) Ready?  
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V Yeah, one sec.  
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V (closes the door) Hey, Elaine  
p65
tp66
a(V ELAINE 
p67
V Hi.  
p68
tp69
a(V GEORGE 
p70
V Coming to the airport with us?  
p71
tp72
a(V ELAINE 
p73
V No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a    break from my roommate.  
p74
tp75
a(V GEORGE 
p76
V Oh, the actress-waitress.  
p77
tp78
a(V ELAINE 
p79
V No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in    some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day     "God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it". She's gonna get it     right in her...  
p80
tp81
a(V GEORGE 
p82
V You just kick her out.  
p83
tp84
a(V ELAINE 
p85
V She's on the lease!...George you have got to find an    other place for me.  
p86
tp87
a(V GEORGE 
p88
V Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in    your price-range. (looks like he remembers something and turns     to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.  
p89
tp90
a(V JERRY 
p91
V I'm not looking.  
p92
tp93
a(V GEORGE 
p94
V No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!   
p95
tp96
a(V JERRY 
p97
V Yeah, what's it like?  
p98
tp99
a(V GEORGE 
p100
V I haven't seen it yet, but it's a "two-bedroom", it's    on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park?  
p101
tp102
a(V JERRY 
p103
V How much?  
p104
tp105
a(V GEORGE 
p106
V Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great    building, it's two bedrooms!  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough    trouble maintaining activity in one. (George looks at Elaine     with a "he's-crazy-look"; Jerry turns around) I saw that.  
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINE 
p112
V You oughtta least take a look at it.    
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V Really? Why?  
p116
tp117
a(V ELAINE 
p118
V 'Cause then I could move in here.  
p119
tp120
a(V JERRY 
p121
V Ooohhhh  
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V It's time you got out a here anyway.    
p125
tp126
a(V GEORGE 
p127
V Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.   
p128
tp129
a(V ELAINE 
p130
V Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have    no hot water, you can't have soft cheese...  
p131
tp132
a(V GEORGE 
p133
V Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on    here for ten years; no human can turn this off.  
p134
tp135
a(V ELAINE 
p136
V Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at    least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live     like this.  
p137
tp138
a(V JERRY 
p139
V Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here.   
p140
tp141
a(V ELAINE 
p142
V Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from    Island to Finland.  
p143
tp144
a(V GEORGE 
p145
V Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the    place or not?  
p146
tp147
a(V JERRY 
p148
V I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to    Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.     (Jerry's apartment. Jerry enters his apartment with his   bags.)  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V Elaine! (puts his bags down, sits down on the couch,    picks up the remote control and tries to turn on his TV)  
p152
tp153
a(V JERRY 
p154
V (notices the TV is missing) ELAINE!    
p155
tp156
a(V ELAINE 
p157
V (from the bathroom) JERRY! (enters the living-room)    Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?  
p158
tp159
a(V JERRY 
p160
V Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR.    (Elaine looks guilty) What?  
p161
tp162
a(V ELAINE 
p163
V They were stolen.  
p164
tp165
a(V JERRY 
p166
V Stolen? When?  
p167
tp168
a(V ELAINE 
p169
V A couple a hours ago, the police are coming right    over.  
p170
tp171
a(V JERRY 
p172
V Stolen?  
p173
tp174
a(V ELAINE 
p175
V (Kramer enters the apartment) Someone left the door    open. (it's clear that she means Kramer; she walks to the   bathroom)  
p176
tp177
a(V JERRY 
p178
V (to Kramer) You left the door open?!    
p179
tp180
a(V KRAMER 
p181
V Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I    came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause     I was gonna bring the spatula right back!  
p182
tp183
a(V JERRY 
p184
V Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?   
p185
tp186
a(V KRAMER 
p187
V (bobs his head guiltily) The door.    
p188
tp189
a(V JERRY 
p190
V The door? You left the door open?  
p191
tp192
a(V KRAMER 
p193
V Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.   
p194
tp195
a(V JERRY 
p196
V Yeah, and?  
p197
tp198
a(V KRAMER 
p199
V Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera...(with    a broken voice) The Bold and the Beautiful  
p200
tp201
a(V JERRY

V So the door was wide open?  
p203
tp204
a(V KRAMER 
p205
V Wide open!  
p206
tp207
a(V JERRY 
p208
V (Elaine enters the living-room) And where were you?   
p209
tp210
a(V ELAINE 
p211
V I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to    heat up.  
p212
tp213
a(V KRAMER 
p214
V Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh, you have insurance,    right buddy?  
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V No.  
p218
tp219
a(V KRAMER 
p220
V (looks shocked) How can you not have insurance?   
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's    the most impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only     ONE DESIGN FLAW  the door...(shuts the door) must be  CLOSED.   
p224
tp225
a(V KRAMER 
p226
V Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it,    I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case!  
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an    accident.  
p230
tp231
a(V KRAMER 
p232
V (theatrical) I made a mistake.  
p233
tp234
a(V ELAINE 
p235
V (idem) These things happen  
p236
tp237
a(V KRAMER 
p238
V (idem) I'm human  
p239
tp240
a(V JERRY 
p241
V In your way.   (Jerry's apartment. A policeman is filling out a   report. Jerry and Elaine are there.)  
p242
tp243
a(V POLICEMAN 
p244
V Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather    jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it?  
p245
tp246
a(V ELAINE 
p247
V Answering machine.  
p248
tp249
a(V JERRY 
p250
V (disappointed) Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea    of somebody out there returning my calls.  
p251
tp252
a(V POLICEMAN 
p253
V What do ya mean?  
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V It's a joke.  
p257
tp258
a(V POLICEMAN 
p259
V I see...Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into    it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find     anything.  
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V You ever find anything?  
p263
tp264
a(V POLICEMAN 
p265
V No. (hands Jerry his copy of the report)    
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V Well, thanks anyway.  
p269
tp270
a(V POLICEMAN 
p271
V You bet.  
p272
tp273
a(V ELAINE 
p274
V (Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters)    I didn't get that joke either.  
p275
tp276
a(V JERRY 
p277
V The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him.    HE'S THE CROOK  why would he answer...(turns around and sees    George standing behind him) How did you get in here?  
p278
tp279
a(V GEORGE 
p280
V (makes some weird motions) I walked in, your lobby    door is broken again.  
p281
tp282
a(V JERRY 
p283
V Again.  
p284
tp285
a(V GEORGE 
p286
V I don't know how you put up with this.    
p287
tp288
a(V ELAINE 
p289
V Yeah, tell'm George.  
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?   
p293
tp294
a(V ELAINE 
p295
V Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel    Merman without the talent.  
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still    available. (George shows him the keys)     (Comedy club.)  
p299
tp300
a(V JERRY 
p301
V I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now,    the first couple a times you go through it, it's very   upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will    
p302
tp303
a(V SAY 
p304
V "Call the police. You really should call the police." So     "Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna     see some real action." Right, you think that. So, the police      GIVE YOU  your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his    copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do   you?...It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the     city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few     crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for   their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot.     "Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin...I think we can     round him up, he's dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him,     he's a PENGUIN!     (The apartment on 83rd street. George, Elaine and Jerry   are entering the apartment.)  
p305
tp306
a(V ELAINE 
p307
V (looks around) Oh, well, come on...this is an    apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live...Oohhh, a     fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work? (takes a closer     look at the fireplace)  
p308
tp309
a(V GEORGE 
p310
V I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this    is incredible.  
p311
tp312
a(V JERRY 
p313
V How do you get all that wood in here?    
p314
tp315
a(V ELAINE 
p316
V They deliver it.

tp318
a(V JERRY 
p319
V They deliver wood?  
p320
tp321
a(V ELAINE 
p322
V Yeah.  
p323
tp324
a(V JERRY 
p325
V Whatta ya tip a "wood guy"?  
p326
tp327
a(V GEORGE 
p328
V (looking intensively at the form with the apartment    description) I didn't know there was a fireplace?  
p329
tp330
a(V ELAINE 
p331
V Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden.   
p332
tp333
a(V GEORGE 
p334
V A garden! I can't believe there's a garden!   
p335
tp336
a(V JERRY 
p337
V Would I have to get a gardener?  
p338
tp339
a(V ELAINE

p350
tp351
a(V ELAINE 
p352
V You can tip a gardener.  
p353
tp354
a(V GEORGE 
p355
V You don't need a gardener.  
p356
tp357
a(V ELAINE 
p358
V Jerry, you can barbecue back here (points to garden).   
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V They deliver the coal?  
p362
tp363
a(V ELAINE 
p364
V Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the    wood.  
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V Oh, than I gotta tip him.  
p368
tp369
a(V ELAINE 
p370

V I don't have any plants.  
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V I have plants.  
p377
tp378
a(V ELAINE 
p379
V Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking    in it! (walks in the closet) It's a "walk-in". Can you believe     it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?!  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V (closes the closet with Elaine still in it)...I like    that. (opens the closet, Elaine walks out with an angry look)     What do ya think, George?  
p383
tp384
a(V GEORGE 
p385
V It's your decision.  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V (walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying    his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking; Elaine is not     able to copy this "move"; they look at each other laughing)     I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place, I'm gonna take it, this     is gonna be my new place, I'm livin' here...I'm movin'.  
p389
tp390
a(V ELAINE 
p391
V (laughing with joy) Your movin'? That means I'm    movin'. (hugs Jerry) Gheeeeee (runs to George) isn't that   incredible!  
p392
tp393
a(V GEORGE 
p394
V Congratulations. (obviously not so thrilled by the    fact)     (Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Elaine are there.)  
p395

p397
V What about the couch?  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY

tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V Yeah.  
p638
tp639
a(V KRAMER 
p640
V The last couple a days he's been acting very strange;    I think he's avoiding me.  
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V Hard to imagine. (ironically)  
p644

tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V Right.  
p650
tp651
a(V KRAMER 
p652
V Ya know, very casually, so that he was gonna take me    in to his confidence.

tp654
a(V ELAINE 
p655
V So what did he say?  
p656
tp657
a(V KRAMER 
p658

V Yeah! (said in his own typical way and he runs off)      (Comedy club)  
p674
tp675
a(V JERRY 
p676
V One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid,    you have a certain way of working out disagreements...and   those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main way     that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them    
p677
tp678
a(V SAY 
p679
V "I got the front seat" (other kid's voice) "I wanted the    front seat!" (first kid again) "I called it". And the other      called it, what can I do?". If there was a "kid-court of law"     IT HOLDS UP  (lawyer's voice) "Your Honour, my client did ask     it?" (lawyer's voice again) "Well no, he didn't call..." BANG!     (imitating a hammer being hit by the judge); (judges voice   again) "He has to call it, case closed...objection overruled".       (Coffee house, called Monk's; Jerry is sitting at a   table, George is returning from the bathroom)

tp681
a(V GEORGE 
p682
V (walks towards the table) I love the mirror in that     in that mirror. (sits down) I don't know if it's the tile or     the lighting...I feel like Robert Wagner.

tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V (bobs his head) It's a good mirror...(both look at    their menus) So, what are ya gettin'?  
p686
tp687
a(V GEORGE 
p688
V I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything     FRENCH FRIES  out, BLT: out!...I go to visit my grandparents:     three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot!      you eat that stuff?!"...(they look at their menus again) I'm     so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know.
