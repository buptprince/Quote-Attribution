aV  THE EX-GIRLFRIEND  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, "Is this the best lane for    me? For my life?" They're always a little bit ahead of you, "Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?" "Yeah, come on over here, pal.    We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.." The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not    even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen?    Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we'll be going "Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad.    I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."     (Jerry's car)

aV She can't kill me right?!  
p6
aa(lp7
V JERRY 
p8
aV No, of course not.  
p9
aa(lp10
V GEORGE 
p11
aV People break up all the time.  
p12
aa(lp13
V JERRY 
p14
aV Everyday.  
p15
aa(lp16
V GEORGE 
p17
aV It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.   
p18
aa(lp19
V JERRY 
p20
aV You tried.  
p21
aa(lp22
V GEORGE 
p23
aV I kept looking at her face. I'd go: "C'mon, love her. Love her!"   
p24
aa(lp25
V JERRY 
p26
aV Did you tell her you loved her?  
p27
aa(lp28
V GEORGE 
p29
aV Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go "Oh, really?" or "Boy, that's, that's    something." But, eventually you have to come back with "Well, I love you." You know, you can only hold out for so long!"    
p30
aa(lp31
V JERRY 
p32
aV You're a human being.  
p33
aa(lp34
V GEORGE 
p35
aV And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.   
p36
aa(lp37
V JERRY 
p38
aV You're too nice a guy.  
p39
aa(lp40
V GEORGE 
p41
aV I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the    bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.   
p42
aa(lp43
V JERRY 
p44
aV You're flesh and blood.  
p45
aa(lp46
V GEORGE 
p47
aV I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But    they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. "This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father."    It's like I'm in quicksand.  
p48
aa(lp49
V JERRY 
p50
aV I told you when I met her..  
p51
aa(lp52
V GEORGE 
p53
aV My back is killing me.  
p54
aa(lp55
V JERRY 
p56
aV You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.   
p57
aa(lp58
V GEORGE 
p59
aV Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.    
p60
aa(lp61
V JERRY 
p62
aV I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.   
p63
aa(lp64
V GEORGE 
p65
aV Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.   
p66
aa(lp67
V JERRY 
p68
aV You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!    (Car door opens, it's Elaine)  
p69
aa(lp70
V ELAINE 
p71
aV Hi.  
p72
aa(lp73
V JERRY 
p74
aV Hi.   (George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back seats)   
p75
aa(lp76
V ELAINE 
p77
aV Hey, what are you doing?  
p78
aa(lp79
V GEORGE 
p80
aV I'm letting you in.  
p81
aa(lp82
V ELAINE 
p83
aV Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.    
p84
aa(lp85
V GEORGE 
p86
aV No, you won't.  
p87
aa(lp88
V ELAINE 
p89
aV Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.   
p90
aa(lp91
V GEORGE 
p92
aV Okay..   (George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the seat)    
p93
aa(lp94
V ELAINE 
p95
aV Why can't you sit in the middle?  
p96
aa(lp97
V GEORGE 
p98
aV Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.   
p99
aa(lp100
V ELAINE 
p101
aV I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?   
p102
aa(lp103
V GEORGE 
p104
aV Is it that obvious?   (Elaine sits in the middle)  
p105
aa(lp106
V ELAINE 
p107
aV Hello, Jerry.  
p108
aa(lp109
V JERRY 
p110
aV Hello.  
p111
aa(lp112
V ELAINE 
p113
aV Did you get a haircut?  
p114
aa(lp115
V JERRY 
p116
aV No, shower. So, where are we eating?    
p117
aa(lp118
V ELAINE 
p119
aV Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or    something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little.. Nothing    much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way.     polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing.   
p120
aa(lp121
V GEORGE 
p122
aV (imitating Tony Bennett) "You know, I'd go from nods to nothing.."   
p123
aa(lp124
V ELAINE 
p125
aV And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.   
p126
aa(lp127
V JERRY 
p128
aV A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.   
p129
aa(lp130
V GEORGE 
p131
aV I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.   
p132
aa(lp133
V ELAINE 
p134
aV Really?  
p135
aa(lp136
V GEORGE 
p137
aV Yes.  
p138
aa(lp139
V ELAINE 
p140
aV You would do that?  
p141
aa(lp142
V GEORGE 
p143
aV If I was a different person.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone)  
p144
aa(lp145
V JERRY 
p146
aV Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..     (Other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials; enter Kramer)   (The buzzer buzzes; Kramer answers it)  
p147
aa(lp148
V KRAMER 
p149
aV Come on up.  
p150
aa(lp151
V JERRY 
p152
aV (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why     can't you.. (guy hangs up on Jerry again). (To Kramer) Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.    (Kramer holds up cantaloupe)  
p153
aa(lp154
V KRAMER 
p155
aV Taste this.  
p156
aa(lp157
V JERRY 
p158
aV No, I just had a sandwich.  
p159
aa(lp160
V KRAMER 
p161
aV No, taste it. Taste it.  
p162
aa(lp163
V JERRY 
p164
aV I don't want cantaloupe now.  
p165
aa(lp166
V KRAMER 
p167
aV You've never had cantaloupe like this before.   
p168
aa(lp169
V JERRY 
p170
aV I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.    
p171
aa(lp172
V KRAMER 
p173
aV Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.  
p174
aa(lp175
V JERRY 
p176
aV Alright.. (tastes it)  
p177
aa(lp178
V KRAMER 
p179
aV Ah, huh. It's good?  
p180
aa(lp181
V JERRY 
p182
aV It's very good.  
p183
aa(lp184
V KRAMER 
p185
aV Good, huh?  
p186
aa(lp187
V JERRY 
p188
aV Good.  
p189
aa(lp190
V KRAMER 
p191
aV I got it at Joe's.  
p192
aa(lp193
V JERRY 
p194
aV Uh-Huh.  
p195
aa(lp196
V KRAMER 
p197
aV Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.   
p198
aa(lp199
V JERRY 
p200
aV It's too far.  
p201
aa(lp202
V KRAMER 
p203
aV It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..   
p204
aa(lp205
V JERRY 
p206
aV I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?   
p207
aa(lp208
V KRAMER 
p209
aV See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.    
p210
aa(lp211
V JERRY 
p212
aV I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.    (Enter George; he's extremely excited - he's dancing around the room, singing the Zorba theme)   
p213
aa(lp214
V GEORGE 
p215
aV I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.    
p216
aa(lp217
V JERRY 
p218
aV You did it? What happened?  
p219
aa(lp220
V GEORGE 
p221
aV I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word "Listen."    
p222
aa(lp223
V JERRY 
p224
aV Ah ha.  
p225
aa(lp226
V GEORGE 
p227
aV I said, "Listen Marlene," and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: "You're doing it! You're doing    it!" And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry. The voice said "Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!" It's like I    was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get     the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!   
p228
aa(lp229
V JERRY 
p230
aV See, it's never as bad as you imagine.    
p231
aa(lp232
V KRAMER 
p233
aV I liked Marlene. What's her number?    
p234
aa(lp235
V GEORGE 
p236
aV No, I, I don't think so.   (Kramer stants making noises while eating)  
p237
aa(lp238
V JERRY 
p239
aV Could you stop that smacking?  
p240
aa(lp241
V KRAMER 
p242
aV George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.    
p243
aa(lp244
V GEORGE 
p245
aV Oh no, thank you.  
p246
aa(lp247
V KRAMER 
p248
aV It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.    
p249
aa(lp250
V GEORGE 
p251
aV No, really. No, no, thanks.  
p252
aa(lp253
V KRAMER 
p254
aV Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.   
p255
aa(lp256
V JERRY 
p257
aV It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's it? You're out?    
p258
aa(lp259
V GEORGE 
p260
aV Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.   
p261
aa(lp262
V JERRY 
p263
aV So, go get them.  
p264
aa(lp265
V GEORGE 
p266
aV Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back    where I started.  
p267
aa(lp268
V JERRY 
p269
aV So forget about the books. Did you read them?   
p270
aa(lp271
V GEORGE 
p272
aV Well, yeah.  
p273
aa(lp274
V JERRY 
p275
aV What do you need them for?  
p276
aa(lp277
V GEORGE 
p278
aV I don't know. They're books.  
p279
aa(lp280
V JERRY 
p281
aV What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?   
p282
aa(lp283
V GEORGE 
p284
aV They're MY books.  
p285
aa(lp286
V JERRY 
p287
aV So you want me to get those books? Is that it?    (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)   (Jerry and Marlene are sitting, a pile of books are on the table.)    
p288
aa(lp289
V MARLENE 
p290
aV ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old     jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, "Marlene, just do it," and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all    these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.   
p291
aa(lp292
V JERRY 
p293
aV So what'd you do?  
p294
aa(lp295
V MARLENE 
p296
aV Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.    
p297
aa(lp298
V JERRY 
p299
aV Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.   
p300
aa(lp301
V MARLENE 
p302
aV (Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.   
p303
aa(lp304
V JERRY 
p305
aV No.  
p306
aa(lp307
V MARLENE 
p308
aV Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.    (Scene ends)   (Chiropractor waiting room)  
p309
aa(lp310
V JERRY 
p311
aV (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.    
p312
aa(lp313
V GEORGE 
p314
aV Jerry, it's not my fault.  
p315
aa(lp316
V JERRY 
p317
aV No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read    Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've    had like three lunches and a movie. And she never stops calling. (George nods - he knows exactly what Jerry's talking about) And it's these meaningless,    purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.    
p318
aa(lp319
V GEORGE 
p320
aV That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?   
p321
aa(lp322
V JERRY 
p323
aV Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?" and I'll go "Oh, hi Marlene." And then it's "Jerry.."    
p324
aa(lp325
V GEORGE 
p326
aV What about getting off the phone?  
p327
aa(lp328
V JERRY 
p329
aV Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, "Alright, then.. " You know, it just goes on and on and on with    out a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.    
p330
aa(lp331
V GEORGE 
p332
aV Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?   
p333
aa(lp334
V JERRY 
p335
aV Yeah. Yes, she is.   (Receptionist enters)  
p336
aa(lp337
V RECEPTIONIST 
p338
aV Mr. Costanza?  
p339
aa(lp340
V GEORGE 
p341
aV Yeah.  
p342
aa(lp343
V RECEPTIONIST 
p344
aV The doctor'll see you now.  
p345
aa(lp346
V GEORGE 
p347
aV (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword puzzle) I better take this. 
p348
aa(lp349
V I 
p350
aV   hate the little room. "Oh, hello, Doctor."   (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p351
aa(lp352
V JERRY 
p353
aV Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says "Waiting room." There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting    room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're    reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them things like "I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm    getting her magazine." And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other    people in the room. "Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later." You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No.    You're going into the next waiting room. The littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest    room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have,    with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, "I have to see this!" "Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do    that to him?" "Are there seats? Can we get in?" Do they scalp tickets to these things? "I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two.."    (Scene ends)   (Waiting room)   (George returns)  
p354
aa(lp355
V JERRY 
p356
aV So, how was it?  
p357
aa(lp358
V GEORGE 
p359
aV I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.    
p360
aa(lp361
V JERRY 
p362
aV Well, it's a first visit.  
p363
aa(lp364
V GEORGE 
p365
aV What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.   
p366
aa(lp367
V JERRY 
p368
aV You can't do that.  
p369
aa(lp370
V GEORGE 
p371
aV Why not?  
p372
aa(lp373
V JERRY 
p374
aV He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.   
p375
aa(lp376
V GEORGE 
p377
aV Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's car)

V MARLENE 
p380
aV Are you feeling weird?  
p381
aa(lp382
V JERRY 
p383
aV No, I'm fine.  
p384
aa(lp385
V MARLENE 
p386
aV Nothing really happened.  
p387
aa(lp388
V JERRY 
p389
aV Yeah, I know.  
p390
aa(lp391
V MARLENE 
p392
aV We just kissed a little. People kiss.    
p393
aa(lp394
V JERRY 
p395
aV Yeah.  
p396
aa(lp397
V MARLENE 
p398
aV Well.. night.   (Leans over and kisses Jerry)  
p399
aa(lp400

p401
aV Good night.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Kramer enters with a golf club)

V KRAMER 
p410
aV I got it! This time, I got it!  
p411
aa(lp412
V JERRY 
p413
aV Alright.  
p414
aa(lp415
V KRAMER 
p416
aV Hips! See, it's all hips.  
p417
aa(lp418
V JERRY 
p419
aV Uh-huh.  
p420
aa(lp421

aV That is out there.   (Kramer notices Jerry's eating cantaloupe, his eyes light up)    
p426
aa(lp427
V KRAMER 
p428
aV Joe's?  
p429
aa(lp430
V JERRY 
p431
aV No, supermarket.  
p432
aa(lp433
V KRAMER 
p434
aV Well, is it good?  
p435
aa(lp436
V JERRY 
p437
aV It's okay.  
p438
aa(lp439
V KRAMER 
p440
aV Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.    
p441
aa(lp442
V JERRY 
p443
aV I'm not taking it back.  
p444
aa(lp445
V KRAMER 
p446
aV Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.   
p447
aa(lp448
V JERRY 
p449
aV I don't care about it.  
p450
aa(lp451
V KRAMER 
p452
aV Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.    
p453
aa(lp454
V JERRY 
p455
aV Alright. Take it back.   (Phone rings, Jerry is reluctant to answer it)  
p456
aa(lp457
V JERRY 
p458
aV (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you back.   
p459
aa(lp460
V MARLENE 
p461
aV (Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.   
p462
aa(lp463
V KRAMER 
p464
aV Well?  
p465
aa(lp466
V JERRY 
p467
aV Marlene  
p468
aa(lp469
V KRAMER 
p470
aV (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene.  
p471
aa(lp472
V JERRY 
p473
aV Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.   
p474
aa(lp475
V KRAMER 
p476
aV I thought you were trying to get rid of her?   
p477
aa(lp478
V JERRY 
p479
aV I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.    
p480
aa(lp481
V KRAMER 
p482
aV Does George know?  
p483
aa(lp484
V JERRY 
p485
aV No, he'd go nuts.  
p486
aa(lp487
V KRAMER 
p488
aV Yeah, no kidding.  
p489
aa(lp490
V JERRY 
p491
aV I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,    psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.   
p492
aa(lp493
V KRAMER 
p494
aV Woah, psycho-sexual.  
p495
aa(lp496
V JERRY 
p497
aV I don't know how I'm going to tell him.    
p498
aa(lp499
V KRAMER 
p500
aV Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?   
p501
aa(lp502
V JERRY 
p503
aV It's partially you, yeah.  
p504
aa(lp505
V KRAMER 
p506
aV You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.   
p507
aa(lp508
V JERRY 
p509
aV Well, he can't kill me, right?  
p510
aa(lp511
V KRAMER 
p512
aV You're a human being.  
p513
aa(lp514
V JERRY 
p515
aV I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.   
p516
aa(lp517
V KRAMER 
p518
aV You're flesh and blood.  
p519
aa(lp520
V JERRY 
p521
aV I'm a nice guy.   (Enter Elaine, she's holding a lamp)  
p522
aa(lp523
V ELAINE 
p524
aV Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)  
p525
aa(lp526
V JERRY 
p527
aV Oh, my little airplane lamp.  
p528
aa(lp529
V ELAINE 
p530
aV You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.   
p531
aa(lp532
V JERRY 
p533
aV Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.   
p534
aa(lp535
V ELAINE 
p536
aV Unless you're married to a dictator..    
p537
aa(lp538
V JERRY 
p539
aV Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.   
p540
aa(lp541
V ELAINE 
p542
aV Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.   
p543
aa(lp544
V KRAMER 
p545
aV Nope. No good.  
p546
aa(lp547
V JERRY 
p548
aV Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.   
p549
aa(lp550
V KRAMER 
p551
aV Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)    
p552
aa(lp553
V ELAINE 
p554
aV So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.   
p555
aa(lp556
V JERRY 
p557
aV Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?   
p558
aa(lp559
V ELAINE 
p560
aV Yep.  
p561
aa(lp562
V JERRY 
p563
aV You talked to him?  
p564
aa(lp565
V ELAINE 
p566
aV Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man."    
p567
aa(lp568
V JERRY 
p569
aV Right.  
p570
aa(lp571
V ELAINE 
p572
aV So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, "Hi, remember me?" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it     out. So I said to him, I said, "You little phony. You know exactly who I am."   
p573
aa(lp574
V JERRY 
p575
aV "You little phony"?  
p576
aa(lp577
V ELAINE 
p578
aV I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once." And I said, "Well, how do you go from that to     totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"  
p579
aa(lp580
V JERRY 
p581
aV Amazing.  
p582
aa(lp583
V ELAINE 
p584
aV And he says, he says, "Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?" And I said, "Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I     wanted you to know that I'm aware of it."   (Elaine tastes some cantaloupe)  
p585
aa(lp586
V JERRY 
p587
aV You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.   
p588
aa(lp589
V ELAINE 
p590
aV This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)     (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)  
p591
aa(lp592
V GEORGE 
p593
aV I don't care.  
p594
aa(lp595
V JERRY 
p596
aV You're kidding.  
p597
aa(lp598
V GEORGE 
p599
aV No, I don't care.  
p600
aa(lp601
V JERRY 
p602
aV You mean that?  
p603
aa(lp604
V GEORGE 
p605
aV Absolutely.  
p606
aa(lp607
V JERRY 
p608
aV You don't care?  
p609
aa(lp610
V GEORGE 
p611
aV No.  
p612
aa(lp613
V JERRY 
p614
aV How could you not care?  
p615
aa(lp616
V GEORGE 
p617
aV I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.   
p618
aa(lp619
V JERRY 
p620
aV I thought you'd be upset.  
p621
aa(lp622
V GEORGE 
p623
aV I guess I should be but I'm not.  
p624
aa(lp625
V JERRY 
p626
aV Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?   
p627
aa(lp628
V GEORGE 
p629
aV No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.   
p630
aa(lp631
V JERRY 
p632
aV That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.   
p633
aa(lp634
V GEORGE 
p635
aV I know, I know.  
p636
aa(lp637
V JERRY 
p638
aV So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?   
p639
aa(lp640
V GEORGE 
p641
aV See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.   
p642
aa(lp643
V JERRY 
p644
aV Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.   
p645
aa(lp646
V GEORGE 
p647
aV I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.    
p648
aa(lp649
V JERRY 
p650
aV Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.   
p651
aa(lp652
V GEORGE 
p653
aV (Angry) You paid that crook?!  
p654
aa(lp655
V JERRY 
p656
aV I had to.  
p657
aa(lp658
V GEORGE 
p659
aV He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?   
p660
aa(lp661
V JERRY 
p662
aV It was embarrassing to me.  
p663
aa(lp664
V GEORGE 
p665
aV I was trying to make a point.  
p666
aa(lp667
V JERRY 
p668
aV Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps) What's wrong?    
p669
aa(lp670
V GEORGE 
p671
aV (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's car)  
p672
aa(lp673
V JERRY 
p674
aV ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?   
p675
aa(lp676
V MARLENE 
p677
aV ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.   
p678
aa(lp679
V JERRY 
p680
aV Really? I thought..  
p681
aa(lp682
V MARLENE 
p683
aV I know, I'm sorry.  
p684
aa(lp685
V JERRY 
p686
aV I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.   
p687
aa(lp688
V MARLENE 
p689
aV You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.   
p690
aa(lp691
V JERRY 
p692
aV Of course I want to talk about it.    
p693
aa(lp694
V MARLENE 
p695
aV Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.   
p696
aa(lp697
V JERRY 
p698
aV Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?   
p699
aa(lp700
V MARLENE 
p701
aV ..I saw your act.  
p702
aa(lp703
V JERRY 
p704
aV My act? What does that have to do with anything?   
p705
aa(lp706
V MARLENE 
p707
aV Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.    
p708
aa(lp709
V JERRY 
p710
aV I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?   
p711
aa(lp712
V MARLENE 
p713
aV I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.   
p714
aa(lp715
V JERRY 
p716
aV You're a cashier!  
p717
aa(lp718
V MARLENE 
p719
aV Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.   
p720
aa(lp721
V JERRY 
p722
aV You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.   
p723
aa(lp724
V MARLENE 
p725
aV I heard the material.  
p726
aa(lp727
V JERRY 
p728
aV I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.    (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p729
aa.
