V  THE EX-GIRLFRIEND  Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld     (Nightclub)   I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, "Is this the best lane for    me? For my life?" They're always a little bit ahead of you, "Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?" "Yeah, come on over here, pal.    We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.." The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not    even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen?    Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we'll be going "Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad.    I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."     (Jerry's car)

V She can't kill me right?!  
p5
tp6
a(V JERRY 
p7
V No, of course not.  
p8
tp9
a(V GEORGE 
p10
V People break up all the time.  
p11
tp12
a(V JERRY 
p13
V Everyday.  
p14
tp15
a(V GEORGE 
p16
V It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.   
p17
tp18
a(V JERRY 
p19
V You tried.  
p20
tp21
a(V GEORGE 
p22
V I kept looking at her face. I'd go: "C'mon, love her. Love her!"   
p23
tp24
a(V JERRY 
p25
V Did you tell her you loved her?  
p26
tp27
a(V GEORGE 
p28
V Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go "Oh, really?" or "Boy, that's, that's    something." But, eventually you have to come back with "Well, I love you." You know, you can only hold out for so long!"    
p29
tp30
a(V JERRY 
p31
V You're a human being.  
p32
tp33
a(V GEORGE 
p34
V And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.   
p35
tp36
a(V JERRY 
p37
V You're too nice a guy.  
p38
tp39
a(V GEORGE 
p40
V I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the    bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.   
p41
tp42
a(V JERRY 
p43
V You're flesh and blood.  
p44
tp45
a(V GEORGE 
p46
V I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But    they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. "This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father."    It's like I'm in quicksand.  
p47
tp48
a(V JERRY 
p49
V I told you when I met her..  
p50
tp51
a(V GEORGE 
p52
V My back is killing me.  
p53
tp54
a(V JERRY 
p55
V You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.   
p56
tp57
a(V GEORGE 
p58
V Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.    
p59
tp60
a(V JERRY 
p61
V I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.   
p62
tp63
a(V GEORGE 
p64
V Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.   
p65
tp66
a(V JERRY 
p67
V You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!    (Car door opens, it's Elaine)  
p68
tp69
a(V ELAINE 
p70
V Hi.  
p71
tp72
a(V JERRY 
p73
V Hi.   (George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back seats)   
p74
tp75
a(V ELAINE 
p76
V Hey, what are you doing?  
p77
tp78
a(V GEORGE 
p79
V I'm letting you in.  
p80
tp81
a(V ELAINE 
p82
V Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.    
p83
tp84
a(V GEORGE 
p85
V No, you won't.  
p86
tp87
a(V ELAINE 
p88
V Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.   
p89
tp90
a(V GEORGE 
p91
V Okay..   (George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the seat)    
p92
tp93
a(V ELAINE 
p94
V Why can't you sit in the middle?  
p95
tp96
a(V GEORGE 
p97
V Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.   
p98
tp99
a(V ELAINE 
p100
V I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?   
p101
tp102
a(V GEORGE 
p103
V Is it that obvious?   (Elaine sits in the middle)  
p104
tp105
a(V ELAINE 
p106
V Hello, Jerry.  
p107
tp108
a(V JERRY 
p109
V Hello.  
p110
tp111
a(V ELAINE 
p112
V Did you get a haircut?  
p113
tp114
a(V JERRY 
p115
V No, shower. So, where are we eating?    
p116
tp117
a(V ELAINE 
p118
V Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or    something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little.. Nothing    much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way.     polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing.   
p119
tp120
a(V GEORGE 
p121
V (imitating Tony Bennett) "You know, I'd go from nods to nothing.."   
p122
tp123
a(V ELAINE 
p124
V And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.   
p125
tp126
a(V JERRY 
p127
V A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.   
p128
tp129
a(V GEORGE 
p130
V I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.   
p131
tp132
a(V ELAINE 
p133
V Really?  
p134
tp135
a(V GEORGE 
p136
V Yes.  
p137
tp138
a(V ELAINE 
p139
V You would do that?  
p140
tp141
a(V GEORGE 
p142
V If I was a different person.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone)  
p143
tp144
a(V JERRY 
p145
V Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..     (Other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials; enter Kramer)   (The buzzer buzzes; Kramer answers it)  
p146
tp147
a(V KRAMER 
p148
V Come on up.  
p149
tp150
a(V JERRY 
p151
V (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why     can't you.. (guy hangs up on Jerry again). (To Kramer) Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.    (Kramer holds up cantaloupe)  
p152
tp153
a(V KRAMER 
p154
V Taste this.  
p155
tp156
a(V JERRY 
p157
V No, I just had a sandwich.  
p158
tp159
a(V KRAMER 
p160
V No, taste it. Taste it.  
p161
tp162
a(V JERRY 
p163
V I don't want cantaloupe now.  
p164
tp165
a(V KRAMER 
p166
V You've never had cantaloupe like this before.   
p167
tp168
a(V JERRY 
p169
V I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.    
p170
tp171
a(V KRAMER 
p172
V Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.  
p173
tp174
a(V JERRY 
p175
V Alright.. (tastes it)  
p176
tp177
a(V KRAMER 
p178
V Ah, huh. It's good?  
p179
tp180
a(V JERRY 
p181
V It's very good.  
p182
tp183
a(V KRAMER 
p184
V Good, huh?  
p185
tp186
a(V JERRY 
p187
V Good.  
p188
tp189
a(V KRAMER 
p190
V I got it at Joe's.  
p191
tp192
a(V JERRY 
p193
V Uh-Huh.  
p194
tp195
a(V KRAMER 
p196
V Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.   
p197
tp198
a(V JERRY 
p199
V It's too far.  
p200
tp201
a(V KRAMER 
p202
V It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..   
p203
tp204
a(V JERRY 
p205
V I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?   
p206
tp207
a(V KRAMER 
p208
V See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.    
p209
tp210
a(V JERRY 
p211
V I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.    (Enter George; he's extremely excited - he's dancing around the room, singing the Zorba theme)   
p212
tp213
a(V GEORGE 
p214
V I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.    
p215
tp216
a(V JERRY 
p217
V You did it? What happened?  
p218
tp219
a(V GEORGE 
p220
V I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word "Listen."    
p221
tp222
a(V JERRY 
p223
V Ah ha.  
p224
tp225
a(V GEORGE 
p226
V I said, "Listen Marlene," and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: "You're doing it! You're doing    it!" And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry. The voice said "Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!" It's like I    was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get     the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!   
p227
tp228
a(V JERRY 
p229
V See, it's never as bad as you imagine.    
p230
tp231
a(V KRAMER 
p232
V I liked Marlene. What's her number?    
p233
tp234
a(V GEORGE 
p235
V No, I, I don't think so.   (Kramer stants making noises while eating)  
p236
tp237
a(V JERRY 
p238
V Could you stop that smacking?  
p239
tp240
a(V KRAMER 
p241
V George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.    
p242
tp243
a(V GEORGE 
p244
V Oh no, thank you.  
p245
tp246
a(V KRAMER 
p247
V It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.    
p248
tp249
a(V GEORGE 
p250
V No, really. No, no, thanks.  
p251
tp252
a(V KRAMER 
p253
V Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.   
p254
tp255
a(V JERRY 
p256
V It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's it? You're out?    
p257
tp258
a(V GEORGE 
p259
V Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.   
p260
tp261
a(V JERRY 
p262
V So, go get them.  
p263
tp264
a(V GEORGE 
p265
V Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back    where I started.  
p266
tp267
a(V JERRY 
p268
V So forget about the books. Did you read them?   
p269
tp270
a(V GEORGE 
p271
V Well, yeah.  
p272
tp273
a(V JERRY 
p274
V What do you need them for?  
p275
tp276
a(V GEORGE 
p277
V I don't know. They're books.  
p278
tp279
a(V JERRY 
p280
V What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?   
p281
tp282
a(V GEORGE 
p283
V They're MY books.  
p284
tp285
a(V JERRY 
p286
V So you want me to get those books? Is that it?    (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)   (Jerry and Marlene are sitting, a pile of books are on the table.)    
p287
tp288
a(V MARLENE 
p289
V ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old     jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, "Marlene, just do it," and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all    these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.   
p290
tp291
a(V JERRY 
p292
V So what'd you do?  
p293
tp294
a(V MARLENE 
p295
V Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.    
p296
tp297
a(V JERRY 
p298
V Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.   
p299
tp300
a(V MARLENE 
p301
V (Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.   
p302
tp303
a(V JERRY 
p304
V No.  
p305
tp306
a(V MARLENE 
p307
V Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.    (Scene ends)   (Chiropractor waiting room)  
p308
tp309
a(V JERRY 
p310
V (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.    
p311
tp312
a(V GEORGE 
p313
V Jerry, it's not my fault.  
p314
tp315
a(V JERRY 
p316
V No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read    Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've    had like three lunches and a movie. And she never stops calling. (George nods - he knows exactly what Jerry's talking about) And it's these meaningless,    purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.    
p317
tp318
a(V GEORGE 
p319
V That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?   
p320
tp321
a(V JERRY 
p322
V Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?" and I'll go "Oh, hi Marlene." And then it's "Jerry.."    
p323
tp324
a(V GEORGE 
p325
V What about getting off the phone?  
p326
tp327
a(V JERRY 
p328
V Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, "Alright, then.. " You know, it just goes on and on and on with    out a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.    
p329
tp330
a(V GEORGE 
p331
V Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?   
p332
tp333
a(V JERRY 
p334
V Yeah. Yes, she is.   (Receptionist enters)  
p335
tp336
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p337
V Mr. Costanza?  
p338
tp339
a(V GEORGE 
p340
V Yeah.  
p341
tp342
a(V RECEPTIONIST 
p343
V The doctor'll see you now.  
p344
tp345
a(V GEORGE 
p346
V (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword puzzle) I better take this. 
p347
tp348
a(V I 
p349
V   hate the little room. "Oh, hello, Doctor."   (Scene ends)   (Night club)  
p350
tp351
a(V JERRY 
p352
V Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says "Waiting room." There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting    room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're    reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them things like "I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm    getting her magazine." And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other    people in the room. "Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later." You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No.    You're going into the next waiting room. The littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest    room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have,    with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, "I have to see this!" "Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do    that to him?" "Are there seats? Can we get in?" Do they scalp tickets to these things? "I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two.."    (Scene ends)   (Waiting room)   (George returns)  
p353
tp354
a(V JERRY 
p355
V So, how was it?  
p356
tp357
a(V GEORGE 
p358
V I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.    
p359
tp360
a(V JERRY 
p361
V Well, it's a first visit.  
p362
tp363
a(V GEORGE 
p364
V What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.   
p365
tp366
a(V JERRY 
p367
V You can't do that.  
p368
tp369
a(V GEORGE 
p370
V Why not?  
p371
tp372
a(V JERRY 
p373
V He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.   
p374
tp375
a(V GEORGE 
p376
V Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's car)  
p377
tp378
a(V MARLENE 
p379
V Are you feeling weird?  
p380
tp381
a(V JERRY 
p382
V No, I'm fine.  
p383
tp384
a(V MARLENE 
p385
V Nothing really happened.  
p386
tp387
a(V JERRY 
p388
V Yeah, I know.  
p389
tp390
a(V MARLENE 
p391
V We just kissed a little. People kiss.    
p392
tp393
a(V JERRY 
p394
V Yeah.  
p395
tp396
a(V MARLENE 
p397
V Well.. night.   (Leans over and kisses Jerry)  
p398
tp399
a(V JERRY 
p400
V Good night.   (Scene ends)   (Jerry's apartment)   (Kramer enters with a golf club)  
p401
tp402
a(V KRAMER 
p403
V Hey.  
p404
tp405
a(V JERRY 
p406
V Hey.  
p407
tp408
a(V KRAMER 
p409
V I got it! This time, I got it!  
p410
tp411
a(V JERRY 
p412
V Alright.  
p413
tp414
a(V KRAMER 
p415
V Hips! See, it's all hips.  
p416
tp417
a(V JERRY 
p418
V Uh-huh.  
p419
tp420
a(V KRAMER 
p421
V You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)   
p422
tp423
a(V JERRY 
p424
V That is out there.   (Kramer notices Jerry's eating cantaloupe, his eyes light up)    
p425
tp426
a(V KRAMER 
p427
V Joe's?  
p428
tp429
a(V JERRY 
p430
V No, supermarket.  
p431
tp432
a(V KRAMER 
p433
V Well, is it good?  
p434

p436
V It's okay.  
p437
tp438
a(V KRAMER 
p439
V Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.    
p440
tp441
a(V JERRY 
p442
V I'm not taking it back.  
p443
tp444
a(V KRAMER 
p445
V Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.   
p446
tp447
a(V JERRY 
p448
V I don't care about it.  
p449
tp450
a(V KRAMER 
p451
V Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.    
p452
tp453
a(V JERRY 
p454
V Alright. Take it back.   (Phone rings, Jerry is reluctant to answer it)  
p455
tp456
a(V JERRY 
p457
V (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you back.   
p458
tp459
a(V MARLENE 
p460
V (Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.   
p461
tp462
a(V KRAMER 
p463
V Well?  
p464
tp465
a(V JERRY 
p466
V Marlene  
p467
tp468
a(V KRAMER 
p469
V (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene.  
p470
tp471
a(V JERRY 
p472
V Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.   
p473
tp474
a(V KRAMER 
p475
V I thought you were trying to get rid of her?   
p476
tp477
a(V JERRY 
p478
V I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.    
p479
tp480
a(V KRAMER 
p481
V Does George know?  
p482
tp483
a(V JERRY 
p484
V No, he'd go nuts.  
p485
tp486
a(V KRAMER 
p487
V Yeah, no kidding.  
p488
tp489
a(V JERRY 
p490
V I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,    psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.   
p491
tp492
a(V KRAMER 
p493
V Woah, psycho-sexual.  
p494
tp495
a(V JERRY 
p496
V I don't know how I'm going to tell him.    
p497
tp498
a(V KRAMER 
p499
V Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?   
p500
tp501
a(V JERRY 
p502
V It's partially you, yeah.  
p503
tp504
a(V KRAMER 
p505
V You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.   
p506
tp507
a(V JERRY 
p508
V Well, he can't kill me, right?  
p509
tp510
a(V KRAMER 
p511
V You're a human being.  
p512
tp513
a(V JERRY 
p514
V I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.   
p515
tp516
a(V KRAMER 
p517
V You're flesh and blood.  
p518
tp519
a(V JERRY 
p520
V I'm a nice guy.   (Enter Elaine, she's holding a lamp)  
p521
tp522
a(V ELAINE 
p523
V Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)  
p524
tp525
a(V JERRY 
p526
V Oh, my little airplane lamp.  
p527
tp528
a(V ELAINE 
p529
V You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.   
p530
tp531
a(V JERRY 
p532
V Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.   
p533
tp534
a(V ELAINE 
p535
V Unless you're married to a dictator..    
p536
tp537
a(V JERRY 
p538
V Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.   
p539
tp540
a(V ELAINE 
p541
V Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.   
p542
tp543
a(V KRAMER 
p544
V Nope. No good.  
p545
tp546
a(V JERRY 
p547
V Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.   
p548
tp549
a(V KRAMER 
p550
V Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)    
p551
tp552
a(V ELAINE 
p553
V So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.   
p554
tp555
a(V JERRY 
p556
V Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?   
p557
tp558
a(V ELAINE 
p559
V Yep.  
p560
tp561
a(V JERRY 
p562
V You talked to him?  
p563
tp564
a(V ELAINE 
p565
V Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man."    
p566
tp567
a(V JERRY 
p568
V Right.  
p569
tp570
a(V ELAINE 
p571
V So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, "Hi, remember me?" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it     out. So I said to him, I said, "You little phony. You know exactly who I am."   
p572
tp573
a(V JERRY 
p574
V "You little phony"?  
p575
tp576
a(V ELAINE 
p577
V I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once." And I said, "Well, how do you go from that to     totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"  
p578
tp579
a(V JERRY 
p580
V Amazing.  
p581
tp582
a(V ELAINE 
p583
V And he says, he says, "Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?" And I said, "Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I     wanted you to know that I'm aware of it."   (Elaine tastes some cantaloupe)  
p584
tp585
a(V JERRY 
p586
V You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.   
p587
tp588
a(V ELAINE 
p589
V This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)     (Scene ends)   (Coffee Shop)  
p590
tp591
a(V GEORGE 
p592
V I don't care.  
p593
tp594
a(V JERRY 
p595
V You're kidding.  
p596
tp597
a(V GEORGE 
p598
V No, I don't care.  
p599
tp600
a(V JERRY 
p601
V You mean that?  
p602
tp603
a(V GEORGE 
p604
V Absolutely.  
p605
tp606
a(V JERRY 
p607
V You don't care?  
p608
tp609
a(V GEORGE 
p610
V No.  
p611
tp612
a(V JERRY 
p613
V How could you not care?  
p614
tp615
a(V GEORGE 
p616
V I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.   
p617
tp618
a(V JERRY 
p619
V I thought you'd be upset.  
p620
tp621
a(V GEORGE 
p622
V I guess I should be but I'm not.  
p623
tp624
a(V JERRY 
p625
V Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?   
p626
tp627
a(V GEORGE 
p628
V No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.   
p629
tp630
a(V JERRY 
p631
V That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.   
p632
tp633
a(V GEORGE 
p634
V I know, I know.  
p635
tp636
a(V JERRY 
p637
V So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?   
p638
tp639
a(V GEORGE 
p640
V See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.   
p641
tp642
a(V JERRY 
p643
V Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.   
p644
tp645
a(V GEORGE 
p646
V I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.    
p647
tp648
a(V JERRY 
p649
V Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.   
p650
tp651
a(V GEORGE 
p652
V (Angry) You paid that crook?!  
p653
tp654
a(V JERRY 
p655
V I had to.  
p656
tp657
a(V GEORGE 
p658
V He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?   
p659
tp660
a(V JERRY 
p661
V It was embarrassing to me.  
p662
tp663
a(V GEORGE 
p664
V I was trying to make a point.  
p665
tp666
a(V JERRY 
p667
V Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps) What's wrong?    
p668
tp669
a(V GEORGE 
p670
V (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?    (Scene ends)   (Jerry's car)  
p671
tp672
a(V JERRY 
p673
V ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?   
p674
tp675
a(V MARLENE 
p676
V ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.   
p677
tp678
a(V JERRY 
p679
V Really? I thought..  
p680
tp681
a(V MARLENE 
p682
V I know, I'm sorry.  
p683
tp684
a(V JERRY 
p685
V I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.   
p686
tp687
a(V MARLENE 
p688
V You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.   
p689
tp690
a(V JERRY 
p691
V Of course I want to talk about it.    
p692
tp693
a(V MARLENE 
p694
V Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.   
p695
tp696
a(V JERRY 
p697
V Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?   
p698
tp699
a(V MARLENE 
p700
V ..I saw your act.  
p701
tp702
a(V JERRY 
p703
V My act? What does that have to do with anything?   
p704
tp705
a(V MARLENE 
p706
V Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.    
p707
tp708
a(V JERRY 
p709
V I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?   
p710
tp711
a(V MARLENE 
p712
V I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.   
p713
tp714
a(V JERRY 
p715
V You're a cashier!  
p716
tp717
a(V MARLENE 
p718
V Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.   
p719
tp720
a(V JERRY 
p721
V You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.   
p722
tp723
a(V MARLENE 
p724
V I heard the material.  
p725
tp726
a(V JERRY 
p727
V I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.    (Scene ends)   (Night club)
